There was rain forecast, but it is only a bit of light drizzle for short periods
in the morning. We have a late start to let the rock dry
off from the nightly rain and then drive to Falesia del Gabbiano.

I need a second try to send the warm up Scarsoman <Grade system="french"
value="6a+" /> because there are some misleading tick marks on crimps in an
overhang. However, it is easier to exit the overhang slightly to the left where
some better, but hidden holds are.

After two half-days of rest and climbing only easy skin-friendly routes
yesterday, my skin is feeling better now. Thus, I can
flash Torcicollo <Grade system="french" value="6b" />, and onsight La
Stangata <Grade system="french" value="6b+" />. Both are a crimpy-technical.
Next, I send Meteora <Grade system="french" value="6c" /> on my second try. It
has a single hard crux on a crimpy undercling and a far reach. Marco manages to
flash it with my beta.

With Molecola <Grade system="french" value="6a+" />, we do another nice layback
crack, before moving to the neighbouring Falesia della Lucertona to do two more
routes. There I send Karma <Grade system="french" value="6c+" /> on my second
try. The route has a bouldery start and gets easier afterwards. Unfortunately,
one of the key holds is clearly artificial.

As some people are sick of Italian food by now, we dine at an Indian place in
Finale today. There aren't many non-Italian places in the region.
