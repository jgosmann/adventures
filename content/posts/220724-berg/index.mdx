Originally, Fabian and I wanted to go climbing in Kochel. However, the train
connection is currently interrupted and thus we decided for Berg at the Lake
Starnberg as an alternative. It is reachable from Munich pretty comfortably and
the crag is in a nice shady area. The latter was a non-negotiable requirement
on this sunny and hot day with up to 30Â°C.

<Loc latlong={[47.9664, 11.3508]} />

The crag itself however is pretty small, the walls barely 12 meters high, the
rock itself is like a pile of pebbles in concrete which takes some getting used
to, and the first bolts are 4 or 5 meters up the ground. Apparently this is what
sport climbing looked like in the early days when this crag was bolted in 1985.

Nevertheless, we start with a route called Magic (<Grade system="UIAA"
value="6+" />) with a reasonable easy start and a crux that I manage to figure
out during my onsight attempt. Next we look at Great Beginning which is supposed
to be of the same grade. However, the start is not as easy and after trying the
first few moves and down climbing again, we decide that the risk is not worth
it. Instead, we take a look at the route Zack und Rauf (<Grade system="UIAA"
value="7" />) to the left of it. There the first bolt is a bit lower and after
few attempts we can clip it. Then it still takes us quite a while to figure out
the beta of all moves. But in the end I can at least climb it clean on toprope
after our lunch break. It feels too hard and risky (to me) to also try a proper
lead redpoint because when clipping the second bolt you still have ground
fall potential and the first bolt isn't easy to clip either.

We then look at the other routes, but none looks very inviting with even higher
first bolts and most being even harder. In the end we do an alternative start of
first route (called Toni's Platte) and call it a day.
