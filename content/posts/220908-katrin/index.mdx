Today, a cold front is forecast to hit at 11am. But first, the weather is
still sunny while we walk in about 30 minutes to the gondola that brings us up
the Katrin. From there we have another 40 minutes of approach along a narrow
trail to the Katrin via ferrata. The sky starts to get increasingly cloudy.

As we finally start the via ferrata, we become engulfed in fog quickly. The via
ferrata is known for its beautiful views of seven different lakes, but I guess we
won't have any of that today. Nevertheless, the fog and wind, together with the
exposure along the arête being climbed, give it a much more adventurous feel.

After about an hour and ascent of 240m, we reach the summit (1542m). It is 11
o'clock and it starts to rain like forecasted.

We quickly start the short 20 minute descent and take the gondola back down.
Along the way back to our flat, we see [empress
Sisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria) and [emporer
Franz Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria) doing
garden work. They used to spend quite some time in Bad Ischl.

We spend the remaining day with grocery shopping, cooking, and relaxing. We also
eat some Zaunerstollen, a local sweet speciality, that we found as a welcome in
our holiday flat.
