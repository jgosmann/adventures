I spend this week together with my parents in Telfs. We arrived by train yesterday
afternoon, got comfortable in our holiday flat, and had a short walk to
explore the city.

The decorations in the flat took a little bit getting used to.

We hope to do some via ferratas this week. Unfortunately, it is supposed to have
multiple showers today. Thus, we decided to do a hike to the Neue Alplhütte
(1504m) via the Straßberghaus (1191m).

We can start the hike directly from our flat. After a short walk through the
city, the first challenge awaits us. We have to find the entrance to a gorge,
but our map does not show the streets precisely and the signage is pretty
minimal. Luckily, a nearby resident saw us standing around a bit lost and
tells us the correct way. It leads through some company grounds which we did not
expect either. We then quickly reach the gorge and start our ascent via the
Telfer Klammsteig.

Eventually, we pass a suspension bridge. It is pretty high above the ground and
swings up and down when walking over it.

So far we did not really have showers, but more a consistent light drizzle.
Nevertheless, strong enough to require a hard shell. Though, the
strenuous ascent makes us sweat a lot and with the high humidity most of the
moisture condensates on the inside of the jacket. As we approach the
Straßberghaus, the rain gets heavier and we have a short break on the roofed
front porch of a small chapel.

After a while we continue through the Steinerne Meer (“rocky sea”). The rain
gear is still wet and putting it back on is pretty uncomfortable.

Finally, we reach the Neue Alplhütte to take off the wet clothes, dry off, and
restore morale with some good, traditional food and drinks.

Unfortunately, our time in the hut comes to an end and we have to descend back
to Telfs. The rain has gotten lighter again, but rarely stops completely.

As we get closer to Telfs, the rain gets heavier again and starts soaking my
soft shell pants, which resisted the rain quite well so far. Luckily, we are soon
back in the flat and can put out everything to dry.

A little bit later in the evening, when we go grocery shopping, it clears up
a bit.

The hike took us about 4:30h and we ascended/descended 865m.
