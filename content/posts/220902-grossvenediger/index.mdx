At 4:30am it is time to get up. I have barely slept all night, but less due to
the altitude and more due to some technical device humming quite loudly all
night. Earplugs did not help much because the vibration would still transfer
through the floor and mattress directly to the ear's bones.

After a short breakfast, we start the hike at about 5:30am in the dark with our
headlamps. Though, within the hour we need to get to the border of the glacier,
it gets bright enough to stow them away. The rocks on the path are quite
slippery from the dew of the night. We also have to cross a stream with even
more slippery rocks.

While we gear up for the glacier, another group arrives. One of them apparently
lost a short prusik cord (required for crevasse rescue). Unfortunately, we
cannot help out. Then they discuss cutting a piece off of a longer one and ask
us for a lighter (to melt the ends to prevent them from fraying). But we cannot
help with that either. While they still discuss what to do, we start to cross
the glacier. I was given the task to lead the party.

It turns out to be quite the labyrinth of crevasses. Some of them are quite
large. But because the glacier is snow-free, they are at least easy to see and
we manage to navigate the terrain.

As we get higher, we get some more snow cover, but also less crevasses.

Eventually, we are almost on top of the gap between the Kleinvenediger and
Großvenediger. But before that, another challenge awaits us: we have to cross
the bergschrund, a giant crevasse. Luckily, there is a fixed ladder installed to
make the crossing easy. Nevertheless, the ladder is much more shaky than one
would imagine and it is barely reaching across. It makes you wonder, how
much longer until the top end of the ladder slides into the crevasse (at least
it is secured from completely slipping down). Though, at the end of the season
in a couple of weeks, it will be removed anyways.

The next bit is quite steep and it is still another strenuous 300m of elevation
or so to the summit. There are two variants and we take the right one that runs
on the West ridge line. At least the snow here is still crusted, which helps to
ascend it.

This last part is quite taxing and it seems that we are hardly making
progress. Maybe my COVID infection is still having an effect? But the other two
are struggling at least as much, even asking for a short breather at one point.
Also, so far I do not feel any headache, which is usually the first sign of
altitude the altitude having an effect (apart from heavier breathing).

Surprisingly, we haven't seen many other parties on our route, but around the
summit, where multiple routes converge, there are much more parties. Some are
already descending, some will be ascending while we descent again later.
Finally, at 10:30am, we make it to the top of the ridge line from where only
a short walk to the summit at 3666m is left.

We have a great view with no one else at the summit! Among others, we can see
the Großglockner and Johannisberg; the area where we had our <Link
to="/posts/210819-alpine-tours-course/">alpine tours course last year</Link>.
Unfortunately, it is also quite windy and despite putting on all cloths that
I have with me, I start freezing immediately and become nauseous. I force myself
to eat a few cookies anyways. I will need the energy for the long descent down,
that we start soon. We take the other variant down. It is a bit more protected
from the wind, South-facing towards the sun, and with the movement I'm quickly
feeling warm and fine again. The snow is now already getting a bit mushier. It's
good that we started early!

Now that the sun melted the thin snow cover on the glacier, it looks much darker
and dirtier. At one crevasse, we would need to cross an ice bridge. We already
crossed it in the morning, but the warmth of the sun won't have helped the
stability. I think it should still be fine, but want the others to hold tension
on the rope, in case it were to break. However, Christian is against crossing
the ice bridge and proposes to go further around to right of it. I think that
this is not a good option. Not only, would it be quite a detour, but it also
leads into an area with even more and bigger crevasses. But I don't want to
force anyone taking a risk they are not willing to take and agree to the
proposal. After a few meters, we're stopped again by crevasses to three sides
of us. We have to turn around and give Christian the lead to take an even longer
detour into the other direction (and quite a bit uphill again) that actually
allows us to go around most major crevasses. We see another party of two that
was behind us crossing the ice bridge without any problems, where we turned
around from, without any problems. Seems like it would have been fine, but as we
are not pressed for time, the detour is fine too.

Off the glacier, we have a break and lay out our crampons to dry off. Shortly
after, the group that we met here in the morning arrives. We haven't seen them
afterwards and assumed, they had turned around due to the missing gear.
Apparently, we missed them because they were just ascending the summit via the
one variant as we were descending via the other. They tell us, they figured out
a walking order so that they have just the right gear to be able to rescue the
person in each position from a crevasse. (We're a bit sceptic about the
approach.)

The trail back to the hut has now dried off and the rocks provide much better
grip. However, the stream from the morning has swollen a bit since then
due to the melt water; making it even harder to cross it with dry feet.

After about 9:45h at 3:20pm, we make it back to the hut and are quite tired. We
ascended and descended about 1200m of elevation today (a bit more than the pure
difference of the hut's and summit's elevation of 1100m).

We enjoy a [soup with
“kaspressknödel” (bread-and-chees
dumplings)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del#/media/File:2015_0731_Tiroler_K%C3%A4sekn%C3%B6delsuppe_Edelweissh%C3%BCtte_S%C3%B6lden.jpg)
and some cake before spending the remaining afternoon relaxing and lying in bed.
Over a tasty dinner (noodle soup, goulash, fruit cocktail), we discuss the next
day.

There is only one more mountain that is realistic to summit from this hut,
the Keeskogel. Because it is not a very long hike, we decide to also go back
home tomorrow instead of staying an additional night. However, we want to avoid
getting into the rain forecasted for the afternoon and thus decide for another
early start, just an hour later than today. Thus, after packing our gear for the
next day, we go to bed quickly again. We talked to the hut's personal and have
hope that they fixed the humming to give us quiet night. We are also the only
three people sleeping in that room tonight which is quite nice.
