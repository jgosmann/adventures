We have a relaxed breakfast on our terrace in the sun. We then visit the first
climbing crag of this vacation: Falesia della Coccinella. There is quite the
trail network here and it turns out quite helpful to have a GPS to stay on the
right track.

We start with easier routes to get a feel for the rock and the grading of the
region. Some previous research revealed that the grading might be a bit stiff
here. The top of the routes provide gorgeous views with a sliver of the
Mediterranean Sea, while the base of the cliff is in the shade of trees and
shrubs.

I some rock cavities, we discover some neatly arranged figurines.

While belaying Jonas, I hear, a couple of meters away, a rock tumbling down, and
Anna voicing an "ouch". Once Jonas is back on the ground, I go over the to check
on her. Evidently, she rolled the ankle of her left food. Putting weight on it
is quite painful for her. Time to get out my first aid kit. We try to stabilize
the foot with an elastic bandage. However, it does not provide enough support.
As she cannot walk herself, how do we get her down the mountain? From my alpine
first aid course, I remember that you can transport a person seated on hiking
sticks stuck behind the backpacks of two persons on either side. But it will be
quite an effort, take a considerable amount of time (it is already late
afternoon), and will get difficult as the major part of the trail is quite
narrow and there are at least two spots with some fixed ropes bordering easy
climbing (i.e. you need your hands).

After short discussion, we decide it is the best option to call the mountain
rescue before it gets too late and dark (complicating any rescue) or making
things worse. Next question is, what is the number of the mountain rescue in
Italy? Or do we just call general European emergency number 112? In the guide
book we find 118 listed for the mountain rescue. As the mountain rescue
hopefully knows the climbing crags (or has means to look them up), it seems like
the better option to us and I dial the number. As I don't speak Italian,
I request English (German was also offered, not sure if that would have been
better) and get forwarded to English speaking personal. Well, sort of English
speaking. We have repeatedly trouble comprehending each other. (Maybe also a bit
due to the connection not being the best and intermittent talking in Italian to
some other person.) Of particular difficulty it is to get across the type of
injury (how hard can it be to understand “rolled ankle”?) and the location. At
least for the location, I eventually get asked for GPS coordinates. Somehow, it
did not occur to me in this situation to provide the location this way. But the
coordinates are easily looked up in the [SOS EU
ALP](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/sos-eu-alp/id400099520) that I have installed
and prominently accessible on my phone's main screen. Then I'm asked whether
the location is accessible by ambulance or helicopter. Well definitely not by
ambulance, but, due to the tree coverage, helicopter also seems unlikely to me
(actually, there is a suitable viewpoint close by, but I forgot about it since
passing it this morning). How am I supposed to judge this? After failing
a couple of times to communicate this, I'm told they will send both, figure it
out on location, and to stay where we are. The whole call took 18 (eighteen!)
minutes and was somewhat frustrating. At times I felt like just hanging up and
solving the problem somehow ourselves. But you're not supposed to hang up an
emergency call and it would probably just have complicated things even more.

Later we find out that 118 was apparently just the general number for medical
emergencies that then notified the mountain rescue. Also, it seems to
recommended to use 112 because many phones will then connect to the best
available network and might also transmit location information automatically.

As we were enough people, we send Jonas (with my GPS) down to the street to
welcome the rescue party and guide them if necessary. I still think this was a
reasonable thing to do, but turned out completely unnecessary as the mountain
rescue was just using their own GPS to navigate to our coordinates and they were
faster hiking up than Jonas anyways.

Shortly after, we hear sirens and then a also a helicopter. The helicopter
circles the area a couple of times. Close to the cliff, I find an opening in the
tree cover, were I can get a line of sight to the helicopter as it circles back.
I make a Y with my arms to indicate “yes, we need help” which gets acknowledged
with a thumbs up by a person on the side of the helicopter if I make it out
correctly. Apparently they lower off a person in some distance.

A couple minutes later the mountain rescuers arrive at our location. Their
English is decent and we can quickly establish what has happened. First they
apply a [SAM splint](https://www.sammedical.com/products/sam-splint?variant=32444250292333)
to fixate the ankle. Then one of the rescuers takes Anna piggyback to carry her
to the viewpoint. Someone else is joking to Anna and Antoine to not be afraid,
the guy already has a girlfriend. The helicopter is called back, one rescuer is
winched up with Anna, and off they fly.

The rest off us starts the hike down (the remaining mountain rescue people
follow a while later, but almost catch up with us until we are down).

Meanwhile we get texted the hospital that Anna was brought to. It is the Santa
Corona hospital in Pietra Ligure, a short drive down the coast from Finale
Ligure.

We make our way to the hospital and try to find the emergency intake. With the
help of a nurse that happens to speak some English (slowly, but not even that
badly) we get the information that Anna is indeed waiting for the doctor in the
emergency intake. But we're not allowed to join her and are told to wait
outside.

The hospital seems a little bit rundown. The soap on the toilet is empty which
also seems problematic in a place where hygiene is particularly important. As
time passes, Antoine eventually slips into the emergency area behind another
person. Only ten minutes later, however, Anna is called into to the doctor.
Again we are waiting a long time without knowing what's happening. Eventually,
the remaining three of us decide to go to a nearby pizza place to grab something
for dinner. We take pizzas to take away for Anna and Antoine. As we return to
the hospital, we can finally pick both of them up. They put a cast around Anna's
foot. Apparently a piece of bone, where the ligament attaches, broke off. It is
way past 10pm as we drive back to our flat.
