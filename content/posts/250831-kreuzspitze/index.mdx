Vroni and I plan a crossing of the Kreuzspitze (2184m) today. To avoid most of
the masses on this beautiful day, we decide to do it backwards. So we first
ascent the Kreuzspitzl (2089m) via a nice and narrow trail.

<Loc latlong={[47.52668, 10.91766]} />

From there we follow a ridge line to the Kreuzspitze. This involves descending
a bit before ascending again. In two or three spots, we need the help of our
hands (depending on the source graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />
or <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />). There is also some steep gravel that is
a bit uncomfortable.

At the summit we have a great view of the Zugspitze and neighboring mountains,
the abruptly ending mountains towards the North and Munich, and even the <Link

From the summit, we descend via the usual path and loop back to our starting
point. We took 5:15h and had an elevation difference of 1250m.
