I'm doing the Nasenwand (“nose wall”, difficulty E) via ferrata today alone. My
parents a doing a short hike in the valley below.

The start of the via ferrata turns out to be wet as it is tucked into the
forest. But it gets better after the first few meters. There are many slabby
spots with friction foot holds to traverse in this via ferrata. One of the more
difficult parts is a somewhat overhanging corner that pushes you outwards.

The crux E spot turns out to be definitely overhanging, but quite short and you
get a good rest spot before and after. It is no trouble at all for me.

The final part of the via ferrata goes up the side of the “nose” providing the
name.

After about 1:50h I top out the via ferrata. I enjoy the view once more before
descending and meeting up with my parents.

We have [Kaiserschmarrn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiserschmarrn)
for lunch in Ginzling. Then we take the bus back to Mayrhofen. There we want to
do a walk through the Stillup gorge, but the trail is closed due to damage from
the recent heavy rain.
