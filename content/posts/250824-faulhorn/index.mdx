We take the train to Wilderswil and from there a historic cog railway to
the Schynige Platte. From there, we hike a panoramic trail more or less along the
ridge line. It is quite busy at first, but gets a bit better as we get away from
the railway station, though it is not exactly a lonely trail.

At the Männdlenen cabin, we have drink. Then we continue to the Faulhorn. It has
a “mountain hotel” on its summit where we eat some soup and have a hot
chocolate.

Now, we descent to the First where it is busier again and the trail turns into
a wide gravel path. At the summit station of the First gondola is a bit chaos.
Some people still coming up don't want to leave their gondola cabin for some
reason. There is a long queue to get down and the tourists are unable to fill
up the gondola cabins. Also the ticket counter, where we still need to buy
a ticket, isn't staffed. But eventually someone turns up, sells us tickets and
we can go down.

The hike took us 5h with 1000m of ascent and 800m of descent.
