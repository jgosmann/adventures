A warm April weekend (20°C and more) invited Antoine and me for another climbing
outing. We go once more to Flintsbach.

<Loc latlong={[47.71756, 12.12464]} />

To warm up, we start with Kinderleicht and Fliegenschiss, both <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6-" />. I climbed them before, but they are nice and there isn't much
easier stuff left in the crag that I haven't climbed yet.

We continue with Knabenkraut <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" /> with a single
tricky spot at an overhang. But once I figured it out (essentially just bringing
your feet up instead of searching for non-existent holds), I was sent easily on
the second try.

Time for something harder. My “project” is occupied, so I try the neighbouring
Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt (“the hope dies last”) <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7+" />, featuring some interesting moves over a bulge. I can sent it on
my second try. Now my “project” Ghostsong <Grade system="UIAA" value="7+" /> is
free and we get on it. I need one go to remember the beta. I also change
some of it up. The route basically goes through the same bulge as Die Hoffnung
stirbt zuletzt (but is different before and after). This allows me to reuse
that beta which is now dialled in and seems a bit easier than <Link
to="/posts/240922-flintsbach/">what I've tried last time</Link>. Then the
route's signature move follows: a high step onto a sloped and slightly slippery
foothold that you have to stand up on and maintain balance. I manage to send
Ghostsong on my second try today.

To pass the time until we can catch the next train, we get onto Animals <Grade
system="UIAA" value="7/7+"/>, finishing the day off. By now I must have climbed
this classic a couple of times, but definitely worth it, even though parts of it
are a bit polished. Today I manage to do a clean repeat without sitting in the
rope.
