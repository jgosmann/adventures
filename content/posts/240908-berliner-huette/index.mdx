With a couple of friends, I had planned a few days at the Berliner Hütte (2042m)
to do some alpine tours from there. Unfortunately, everyone except Fabian had to
cancel. So it is only us two ascending to the hut, where we already <Link
to="/posts/230812-berliner-huette/">stayed a night last year</Link> before <Link
to="/posts/230813-zsigmondyspitze/">climbing the Zsigmondysptize</Link>.

The weather is nice at first, but, as we get closer to the hut, the sky gets
covered in clouds. We have a short break near the Alpenrose inn before the final
30 to 45 minute ascent, where we leave the gravel road and enter a proper
mountain trail.

We reach the hut early afternoon after about 2:10h and an ascent of about 750m.
We have drinks on the patio. From there we can observe that the glacier across
(Hornkees) has gotten visibly smaller compared to last year.

Not much later, it starts to rain lightly and we move inside. We spend the
remainder of the afternoon with discussing our plans for tomorrow and reading.
For dinner we get Tiroler Gröstl and Käsespätzle.
