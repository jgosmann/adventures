After the first rainy days, the weather, finally, turns sunny. We make use of it
for the first day of climbing in Stuls.

<Loc latlong={[46.82932, 11.18858]} zoom={13} />

The approach leads through some private property, where two dogs come running
towards us. While one of them seems pretty chill, the other one is barking
loudly. But we won't be intimidated and the owner orders them back.

The wall is mostly dry when we arrive, but there is a corner that is still quite
wet. My second warm-up, Johannesgraben <Grade system="french" value="5c" /> goes
right through the wettest spot. But after having seen Jonas to climb through it,
I don't give in and manage too. It has some nice and interesting moves that
require a bit of thinking.

After a few more easier, but also quite enjoyable routes, I get onto _the_
classic route of the sector: Kellekesch <Grade system="french" value="6b+" />
and manage to onsight it. To me it seems to be graded almost a bit softly. The
climbing, however, is great with short cruxes intermixed with good rests.

Motivated by the success, I try Tektonen <Grade system="french" value="6b" />
and can also onsight it. It is an extension to the earlier warm up
Johannesgraben that, has dried off a bit more since then. Tektonen itself follows
a large flake and is quite a bit more overhanging than expected. It is hard to
tell the overhang when standing on the ground. But the climbing is quite cool
and it is always nice when you keep it together, not give up, and push through
such a route.

To finish the day, I try the <Grade system="french" value="6c" /> extension
Linksverkehr (“left-hand driving”) to Kellekesch. It is quite crimpy and a bit
overhanging. I have to take multiple breaks; maybe it is a project for the
future.

All in all, a very successful and sunny (even hot) day of climbing with amazing
routes. The view was also splendid. To celebrate we have some cake and drinks at
a nearby place in Stuls. I decide for the tasty tiramisu cake.

For dinner, Anja and Jonas make a delicious stew with wheat berry, tofu, and
green beans.
