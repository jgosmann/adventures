Fabian and I use a short good weather window for a show shoe hike this Sunday.
We start in Kufstein, which means the train stops at Munich East. That is quite
convenient for me as it is closer than the Munich Central Station and I can
wake up a bit later (but it is still as early as 5:15am).

We arrive around 8am, shortly after sunrise and see the first mountain tops
being covered in golden sunlight. First, we head South on a rather flat trail
and later turn East where we gain some elevation. The snow cover is still thin
and snow shoes are not yet of any use.

Eventually, we leave the well trodden paths and get into deeper snow. Initially,
we still get by quite well without snow shoes, but decide to put them on a while
later. After all, they do help in the quite loose and powdery snow.

After about 3:30h, we reach the summit of the Hochegg (1470m). A bit below the
summit, we find a sunny patch where we have our lunch break. I brought some tasty
beet and feta samosas leftover from yesterday.

As we get ready to continue, another hiker arrives. He
is pretty much the first person we see on the trail. Because he has no snow
shoes, he was quite happy about the trail we created in our ascent.

We then continue to the Gamskogel (1449m) in a quite extended Eastwards loop
that follows mountainsides on roughly the same elevation. Thus, we do not need
to descent and then ascent a lot of elevation. Again we meet no one. At times it
is also incredibly quiet. In one spot, we surprise a few chamois that run away
from us.

From the Gamskogel, we descent back to Kufstein via the Brentenjoch. From here
on, we meet much more people and soon do no longer need our snow shoes. We've
got our timing down and catch a train back to Munich with just 10 minutes to
spare.

In total (without the lunch break), we took 7:30h for the hike, ascended
about 1400m, and hiked about 21km.
