The cleaning lady will stop by this morning. Thus, we have breakfast in Finale
Ligure. We also intend to have a rest day. But at least the plans to swim in the
sea are cancelled because of strong winds and high waves.

But apart from that the weather turns out to be better (i.e. drier) than
expected. Thus, Antoine, Marco, and me decide to go climbing after all in the
afternoon at Parete delle gemee.

Though, we stick to quite easy stuff that is also somewhat easy on my
skin. Especially the routes Finale by Thomas <Grade system="french" value="5c" />
and La cascata pietrificata <Grade system="french" value="6a" /> turn out to be
really enjoyable climbing and with about 30 meters are also quite long. The
former starts with a really nice layback crack, the later has a part across
sinters that feels like climbing on octopus tentacles. Really weird rock!
We call it a day at the right time, and arrive home as the rain starts again.

We have dinner in Finalborgo and I'm hungry enough to do the whole program with
primi piatti (pasta), secondi piatti (prawns), and Tiramisu.
