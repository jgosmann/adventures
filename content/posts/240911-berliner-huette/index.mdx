Today, the weather finally turned sunny again. Unfortunately, it is our last day
and we have to descent and go back to Munich. However, tomorrow it is supposed
to turn much worse with snow down to 1300 meters anyway.

The descent of 1:45h is pretty uneventful, but provides us with some nice views.
We conveniently catch a bus back to Mayrhofen with just 5 minutes to spare. But
in Jenbach we have to wait over three hours for our train. It doesn't help that
the train is delayed by about 40 minutes. However, if we had booked an
earlier train, it could have been quite stressful to catch.
