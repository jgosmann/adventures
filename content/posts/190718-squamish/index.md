I mentioned our campsite neighbours a couple of times. We chatted a little bit
and they recommended to us the six pitch climb Centurion. It is not in the
guidebook, so they gave us their [printout from Mountain
Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/111739226/centurion). Vera and
I want to do that climb today. Buf first we need to find it.

{{< loc "49.9354914" "-123.1576047" "11">}}

The printout gives us a textual description of the approach, a satellite image
with the approach marked, and an elevation profile of the approach.
Unfortunately, we do not have the picture of the trail head that is available on
Mountain Project. It could have been really helpful.

We know that the area we are looking for is somewhere beyond the usual Cheakamus
Canyon parking. Christine and Tim drive us there and the all-wheel drive comes
in handy again on the logging road that follows. According to the description we
are looking for the first major switchback on that road. After a while we reach
a slight right-ward bend at a split in the road and agree that this might be the
switchback we are looking for. So Christine and Tim drop us off and head
somewhere else to do some trad climbing.

What is slightly worrying is that the area is clear-cut. We quickly realize that
we either cannot be right or that the trail has been covered under the debris of
dead trees. But if that is the case, our campsite neighbours should have told us
about it.  So we decide this cannot be the “first major switchback” and continue
walking up the road which gives us a view on some nice cliffs.

{{< rimg src="4.jpg" caption="Are these the cliffs we are looking for? We figure out later, yes they are. The route is on the left-most part.">}}

Just a little bit further, we find another fork in the road and an actual switch
back.

{{< rimg src="19.jpg" caption="This must be the first major switch back!  (Looking back to where we came from.)">}}

The descripition tells us to get onto a trail to the left. So we follow the fork
to the left. It is still more a road than trail, but the description also calls
the trail an old logging road. Seems to match the description and we continue
the road uphill for at least 20 minutes. But we do not get to a boulder field as
we should in that time, also my altimeter shows that we are on a higher
elevation than we should be according to the elevation profile. We have no
choice but to head back and try to find two other landmarks given in the
description: a creek in a sharp corner of the road and a campsite with a large
fire ring (though it is unclear whether that still exists as the description is
six years old). I backtrack a good distance beyond the switchback, but cannot
identify the creek. The only fire ring that we find is close to the switchback
and rather small.

{{< rimg src="18.jpg" caption="Is this supposed to be a large fire ring?">}}

Obviously, the textual information is insufficient to find the approach trail.
The satellite image is no help because basically everything is just forrest.
We could hike all the way back to the Cheakamus parking area and start from
there to use the hiking time measurements to find the correct locations (as we
drove in part of the way, we do not know how much of the 35 minutes of hiking to
the first waypoint is still left from the point where we are). As the total
approach takes about an hour, we would to hike down and then all the way up
again, this does not seem like a great option.

Luckily, we have cell phone reception. Activating the data roaming on my phone
will cost me a bit, but is not insanely expensive. That allows me to download
the satellite image on Google Maps where I can also see my location and then
cross-reference with the satellite image on the printout using the few landmarks
that are non-forrested. Turns out that switchback where we are back at is not
the “first major switchback” on the road! (I suppose it was not there six years
ago?) We actually have to hike the road we went up before (again, sigh), but not
as far as we went. There is another switchback which is the one we are looking
for.  Close to it is a pull off where the trail starts. We looked at it before,
but if you do not know that there is a trail, you just do not see it.

{{< rimg src="17.jpg" caption="Where is the trail?">}}

We then follow a faint trail through thick West Coast rainforrest for about 20
minutes. It is actually a quite nice hike. Even though well camouflaged, we see
a grouse with a chick. Surprisingly they do not flee as we pass.

{{< rimg src="7.jpg" caption="The boulder field tells us that we are almost there">}}

Then we finally make it to the boulder field that we have to cross to finally
get to the start of the climb. Which turns out to be a mossy and wet slab! And
that after running around for hours to get here. We are too invested now to
leave. Closer inspection reveals that there are some good features and it might
be climbable in the wet state, hoping that it gets drier higher up. While putting
on the climbing gear it starts raining. Shit! We wait a little bit and it stops
again. So we decide to start the climb. I lead the first pitch (5.10a). Indeed
the start is quite doable (though I weight the rope once or twice) and as I get
a little bit higher the rock starts getting drier.

{{< rimg src="8.jpg" caption="Start of the first pitch">}}

{{< rimg src="9.jpg" caption="At the anchor after the first pitch">}}

Vera leads the second pitch (5.8) which is scrambling for the most part. Then
I am back to leading. Pitch 3 (5.10b) starts steep, has a slabby crux and is
sustained. Pitch 4 (5.10c) is the crux pitch. First you have to pull from under
a roof onto a small slab which took me some attempts to figure out. Then you
have to diagonally traverse that slab upwards under another small roof. There
was a wet streak increasing the difficulty, but I made it through. Pitch 5 and
6 (both 5.10a) bring more slab climbing and some more light and short rain
showers. But we make it all the way to the top and can enjoy the view.

The wind up there is strong and cold. Thus we soon rappel back down.

It definitely was a very fun climb with neat exposure in a somewhat remote
location. We did not meet or see any other climbers there.

After meeting up with Christine and Tim again, we decide to have Sushi for
dinner, but we are too hungry to wait for a free table and go to an Indian place
close by. Unfortunately, we have to wait quite long for our food there, but it
is delicious.
