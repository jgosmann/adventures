We go to Murrin Park today where we meet up with Olivia and her friend Esti.
I met Olivia at one of the Nengo Summer Schools organized by the lab I did my
PhD in. We warm up on Oscar's Slab. It has a slight scary, cruxy middle part and
feels how so often on slab a little bit harder than what the grade suggests. We
continue with Zoë, another top 100 climb, and More Than Just a Pretty Face which
is also a fun climb that I get on the second try. In-between the tries, I climb
In the Doghouse which is supposed to <Grade system="YDS" value="5.7" />, but instead of stemming using the
nearby opposing wall, I want to know whether I can do it without that wall.
Turns out I can as I onsight the climb that in this variant feels closer to

<Grade system="YDS" value="5.10a" />.

We also do A Bachelor's Life memorial Arête before moving on to a different wall
with the top 100 <Grade system="YDS" value="5.11a" /> Pleasant Pheasant. That wall is quite high and looks
intimidating (most climbs on the wall are in the 5.12 range). Another couple is
on the climb and we have to wait. The guy bails mid-route which is not super
confidence inspiring. The girl has to finish the climb and makes it look a bit
more doable, but has some trouble too. At least she almost finishes, just uses
the slightly lower anchor of the neighbouring route to the left. Anyways, I'll
try it and with a few takes (and a fall I believe) I make it up all the way.
Definitely not an easy <Grade system="YDS" value="5.11a" />, but trying it is good for my mental game.

We finish climbing slightly earlier than the last days which gives us the chance
to get shower (for \$5) at the recreation centre in Squamish and to buy some
groceries afterwards. Olivia and Esti are staying at the same camp ground and
already started a fire in our pit when we get back. We grill hot dogs and smores
over the fire before heading to bed.
