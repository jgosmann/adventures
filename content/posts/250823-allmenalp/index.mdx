Today, we are doing the Allmenalp via ferrata. It is quite popular and the first
part we are behind a slow group of three. But at the first rope bridge we can
overtake them.

After that the via ferrata splits. My parents do the easier variant, while I do
the harder D variant. Before another rope bridge, we join up again for the last
bit. It is a quite long via ferrata and for a good part you are in a quite steep
wall. We definitely enjoyed it.

After topping out, we walk to the Almenalp where we have a soup with sausage
before taking the gondola back down. It is a quite small gondola with a cabin
for only up to eight people, and at the summit station it is self-service.
That means you have to press the right buttons to open the door and signal the
station in the valley to bring you down.

We took 2:45h to ascent the 475m of the via ferrata to the Allmenalp at about 1700m.
