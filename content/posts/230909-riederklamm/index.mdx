Today we do the Riederklamm via ferrata. There are multiple variants at the
start and we take the most difficult one, rated C/D, but most of it is supposedly
only C. However, the grading turns out to be a little bit stiff.

This is followed by a rope bridge and a traverse. Then we reach the highlight of
the via ferrata: a 70 meter rope bridge.

In the final part after the rope bridge, one has the option to take an
overhanging E variant. Of course I do that one. It is indeed quite overhanging,
but short.

After about 1:30h we are finished with the via ferrata, return to Mayrhofen,
and have some pizza for late lunch.

In the evening we do a night hike along the Zillertal and back besides the river
Ziller.
