No bear eats us in the night.

We made good progress the last two days and it is not that far to the last
feasonable camp spot before the descent to our destination Stehekin. Thus, we
plan on doing some extra hiking with less gear on top of the next ridge line.
But first we have to get there.

On top of the ridge line we leave most of our gear behind, and wander off-trail
on top of the ridge line to the first peak we can see.

That did not take very long. We decide to continue even further and trying to
ascend the big mountain that we can see in the ridge line curving around.

Well we make it quite close, but get to a spot that gets quite steep and seems
unsafe to descend. Also, on the other side of that descend getting to the top of
the mountain seems to require some actual climbing. Thus, we decide, to just
enjoy the still amazing view in the spot we are right now, have a break, and
head back.

After picking up our gear, we soon leave the Sawtooth Wilderness and enter the
Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, though we will cut back close to the
border at the end of the day.

After only 7h and 11.5km, we make it early to the lake where we camp. We
ascended 690m and decsended 632m tody. Our peak elevation was at 2277m.

It does not make sense to go any further today because we will soon start
a steep descent with likely no spots flat enough to pitch a tent. Also, this is
a good campsite because there is a composting toilet nearby. So we do not have
to dig any holes.

Because we are so early, Peter and I climb a nearby ridge line and minor
mountain without our backpacks and can enjoy another amazing view.
