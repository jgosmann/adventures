While the avalanche danger was very high at the beginning of January, it settled
at a 2 out of 5 this weekend. That allowed me to do my frist snow shoe hike of
the season and to try out my newly acquired snow shoes. Fabian, Emil, and me
decided to climb the Simetsberg, a mountain in the lower Alps south of Munich.

We take the first reasonable public transport connection at 7:59am from Munich
central station. There we see quite a number of skiers and snow boarders heading
out too. After about an hour-long train ride, we change into a bus that drops us
at our starting point in Obernach after another 30 minutes. From there we start
walking. It is snowing a bit, but we ascend 100 or 200 meters before we decide
that the snow is getting too deep and we put on our snow shoes.

The first section goes gently uphill.

A little bit below the tree line we pass some signage. Presumambly this sign
post stands taller than a human in the summer. That means we are walking on
a hell lot of snow! We also use this spot to eat a little bit because it might
get colder once we get above the tree line.

From now on it gets steeper and I am quite happy that my new snow shoes have
a heel lift to make the steep ascends much more comfortable.

As expected it gets a bit colder and quite windy once we leave the tree line.
Consequently we layer up. The last 100 to 200 meters of the 1060 meters total to
ascend get really steep again, but we eventually make it to the top of the
Simetsberg at an elevation of 1840m and get hit even more by the wind. The
summit cross has some impressive ice formations on it.  (Unfortunately, my
camera lens got wet and foggy and the following pictures suffered in quality.)

Conveniently, the cloud cover breaks open a bit and rewards us with some nice
views.

Before we start freezing, we begin to descent again. Especially the steep part
is fun to glide down on the snow shoes and takes a fraction of the time to get
up there.

On our way down we discover some more nice views that we missed on the way up
due to the thick cloud cover.

Back at the starting point, we have to wait an hour for the next bus. Luckily,
with the temperature around the freezing point, it is comparably warm (at least
to what I am used to from Canada). But when the bus finally comes, the cold
nevertheless started to creep into the toes. Anyways, a fun day trip!
