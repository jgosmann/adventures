After a few days of pure via ferratas, we wanted a bit of variation and decided
for more of an alpine hike with a via ferrata along the final ridge to the
Wankspitze (2209m). The starting point is a short bus ride away.

The first short stretch follows a small stream along some green meadows
and through some forested areas.

Then the actual ascent begins. Until the Lehnberghaus it is mostly a rather wide
gravel path. But then the trail starts to get more rocky and alpine.

The views are also getting increasingly better. The final ascent before the via
ferrata to the Stöttltörl (a notch in the ridge line) turns into switch backs on
a steep field of scree.

At the Stöttltörl we have a lunch break. Then we walk up the last few meters and
start the via ferrata traversing the ridge line. It is not especially hard (C),
but has some nice climbing and good views. Though, in several spots the rock is
extremely loose and one can easily trigger rockfall by accident.

A few times, we have to down climb before climbing up again on the other side of
some notch.

On the last smaller peak before the main summit, a small bench was installed for
a short break to enjoy the view.

Not long after, we make it to the summit of the Wankspitze with a great
panoramic view. There we have another break.

For the descent, we take a normal hiking trail which leads directly back to the
Lehnberghaus. Shortly before, we find an inviting bench and have another break
there. Next to it is also a viewing platform, but it seems pretty useless after
having seen the view from the summit. Eventually, we manage to continue the last
few meters to the Lehnberghaus where we have some quick drinks and some cake
before quickly continuing our descend to be sure that we catch our bus back to
Telfs. The whole tour took us 6:30h with 1255m ascended and descended.
