Other people sleep in on weekends. I once again do the opposite and get woken up
by my alarm at 5am on a Sunday. Wolfgang and I have a somewhat serious alpine
tour planned for today: ascending the Alpspitze (2628m) via the multipitch rock
climbing routes BW3 (<Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />) and Adamplatte (“Adam's
slab”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="4-" />).

<Loc latlong={[47.4295, 11.04781]} />

The climbing duration is supposed to be six hours alone, without approach and
descent. We want to maximize our chances to catch the last gondola down (at
5:30pm) to avoid having to descent another 1280m after the tour. Thus, we leave
Munich early (and by car) to catch the first gondola up to the summit station of
the Osterfelderkopf (2030m).

At this early time, we avoid traffic, make it through quickly, and arrive about
30 minutes before the official opening time of the gondola. Enough time to eat
a banana, visit the restrooms, and buy the gondola ticket. It also turns out that
the first gondola this day departs about 10 minutes before the official
time which adds a little bit time to our budget.

From the summit station it isn't a very long approach (less than 30 minutes). But
we take some time to orient ourselves and to find the correct ledge that leads
to the route BW3. It would also be possible to climb the Mecki-Pfeiler (“Mecki
pillar”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />) to get to the ledge, but walking
around on easy terrain is quicker because we can move at the same time and do
not need to coil up the rope once more to traverse the ledge which has only a few
spots of <Grade system="UIAA" value="1" />.

Then we get to the actual start of the route, or so we think because we are at
a dot of purple paint and the topo of the route mentions such purple points.
While we are getting ready, another pair of climbers (that we overtook earlier
when they were having breakfast) catches up to us and together we figure out
that we are at the start of the KG route. The actual start of BW3 is a one or two
meters further left. Now we also notice the faint letters KG on the purple dot.
Note: navigating alpine climbing routes is not easy. We are courteous and let
the other party start in front of us.

Then, about one hour after leaving the summit station, I start the climb with
the first lead. We decided to [swing
leads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfJVe2fNGM) because it is the most
efficient style. It allows us to build the anchors quickly with just a few
carabiners and the rope. Also, after seconding a pitch that person has already
collected most of the required gear and can start directly the next pitch
without swapping much equipment.

Wolfgang gets to lead the second pitch with the first slabby crux and the second
to last pitch which is also part of the crux pitches. I get the final crux pitch
which is a sustained <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />, but luckily not as
slabby like the first crux. The bolt distances are okay-ish for the difficulty,
but it is definitely not a sport route. Having the other party in front of us
helps a little bit with the route finding and we make it through the whole
5 pitches in about two hours. The route exits to rubble ledge. Here we could
abort and exit to the Alpspitz via ferrata, but so far we are still within the
allotted time and we continue.

After crossing the rubble field to the so called Herzl, we ascent about
250m walking and climbing in easy terrain (<Grade system="UIAA" value="1" />).
A memorial plaque, some other signs, and a few red markings help a bit with the
orientation and we do not have too much trouble finding the start of the
Adamplatte. This route is more alpine in style than the previous BW3. It has
fewer bolts and in a few places pitons are used instead of bolts. The transition
between routes took us about 30 minutes.

After an easy first pitch, it is my turn to lead again. The route follows
a groove and is easy to find. But then I get to a spot where I think the next
anchor should be here. I look around, but cannot find anything. Wolfgang yells from
below that the other party went to the right. I'm unsure. Yes, the route will
continue to the right, but the anchor should be before that. Then the current
belayer of the party above me notices that I am looking around and tells me the
route would continue to the right, it would be a long “50 meter pitch” and it is
“way too early for the anchor”. So I continue onto the slab to the right. Still
thinking that I am in my pitch before the route goes way more to the right,
I still keep more to the left side. This section feels much harder than
the <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" /> rating in the topo. But I guess that is
because it is a slab? Those have this characteristic trait of feeling hard.

It doesn't really help that the only protection are pitons and no solid bolts
with quite runout distances. There isn't even any place to put in a nut as
additional protection. Parts of the climb are also somewhat wet. Then I start
realizing I am way into the next pitch. This is bad. Both pitches combined are
about 70m, but our rope is only 60m. The last piton is quite a few meters below
me. I really don't want to down climb this slab! Nor do I want to fall on it!

Trying to keep somewhat calm, despite the anxiousness rising, I discover two
pitons, close to each other, only a short distance to the left above me.
Two pitons! That is enough to have at least a redundant anchor, even if it won't
be as secure as proper drilled bolts. I gather some more courage and climb the
remaining distance to those pitons. First, I secure myself at the upper piton, sit
back, and ... it holds. Relief! Next step: redundancy. The lower piton has only
a small hole and some cord is hanging in it. I just cannot get any carabiner
through. Unfortunately, I do not have one of those climbing knives that attaches
to the harness. I've got a pocket knife somewhere in my backpack, but do not
really want to search for it. So I add my own cord to attach a carabiner and
make the anchor redundant. With the most immediate danger, eliminated
I reconsider the safety of the anchor. The pitons are hammered in deep, which is
good, but there is no way to tell for sure how solid they are. I also connected
them in row, so that one of them will take the full load in case of a fall. This
is the usual way to build anchors on solid bolts (in Germany), but is not ideal
with questionable anchors. Also, one usually wants a three-way redundancy on
questionable anchors. I evaluate my options. Well, my only option; because the only
way to add more redundancy would be with a nut. I take a close look at the
structures left of me and indeed find a suitable little crack. It is only big
enough for a small nut, but after having seen [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4rMCCPiTM) I feel that it would
actually be pretty solid. At least with a downward pull. With a sideward pull it
might pop, but luckily it would be hard to create a sideways pull. I then try to
equalize the load between the nut and one of the pitons, though, it doesn't work
very well because they too far apart (or my cord/slings too short) and the
angles are weird. But anyways, at least it is three pieces and I feel somewhat
comfortable to trust my (and my climbing partner's) life to it.

I then belay Wolfgang up to the point where I missed the anchor and he is
(conveniently) back in my line of sight again. He actually finds the anchor
I missed. It is way to the left where I haven't looked (and didn't expect it).
When you look into the topo, it is actually marked on the left side of the
route. Note: navigating alpine climbing routes is hard! Also: pay attention to
every miniscule detail in the climbing topo and be careful of what other people
tell you. I tell Wolfgang to set up the anchor and belay me again. I have
discovered that not much above me seems to be a small ledge that should allow me
to traverse right back into the proper climbing route. That route should be
easier and allow me to get to the next anchor of that pitch. Those few meters of
climbing turn out to be very doable, the ledge is quite ok, and, surprise, has
even the bolted anchor of the proper pitch that one was supposed to climb. Such
a relief! I belay Wolfgang up to me and we climb the remaining few proper
pitches without any issue.

Other people, presumably some hikers, were less lucky as a rescue helicopter
appears (<Link to="/posts/210807-hoher-gaif/">like the last time I was in this
area</Link>). It seems to pick someone up in the flatter part below the main
wall as far as I can follow the rescue while continuing to climb.

The final two pitches of <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" /> follow a ramp and
neither have any bolts in-between the anchors nor good placements for nuts or
other mobile protection. Because these pitches cannot be protected well, we
decide to do them without rope to save some time. No falling allowed!
Unfortunately, the ramp we are on narrows and we have to get to another ramp
below us. It is not clear what the best way to do so is. Climb and go down at an
earlier spot? Or down climb right here? Or use a thin hourglass to rappel from?
I decide to down climb here. It is probably not harder than <Grade system="UIAA"
value="3-" />, but you have to be careful. Wolfgang decides for the rappelling
method which also works well (but takes some more time).

Then we make it to the end of the climbing without further issues and join the
Alpspitz ferrata for the last few meters to the summit of the Alpspitze. The
Adamplatte took us 3:20h. Thus, we actually made a good time considering that
I lost quite a bit of time with the improvised anchor.

<Rimg src="6.jpeg" caption="The summit!" />

We have a short break and discuss our descent options: either the Ostgrat
(eastern ridge line) or the Alpspitz ferrata. Both are via ferratas of about the
same difficulty (B). The Ostgrat is longer, but has less rockfall potential.
Going down the Alpspitz ferrata is also against the direction most people go, so
we might have to deal with people passing. Nevertheless, we are both tired and
the prospect of getting down a bit quicker lets us decide for the Alpspitz
ferrata. At this time of day there should not be too much traffic on it anymore.
Anyone still going up at this time might have a hard time to catch the last
gondola down and with few people on the ferrata the rockfall hazard is also
less. Indeed, not a single person comes our way, but a few others use the same
.

Back at the gondola summit station (after a one hour descent), we have something to
eat and drink before going back down and driving back to Munich. Unfortunately,
we now hit the main wave of traffic returning to Munich from the mountains and
are stuck in traffic for a while. But this was to be expected.
