I have breakfast about half an hour earlier, around 7:30 am today. It is a funny
picture at the breakfast. It seems that mostly solo travellers are staying the
the hostel at the moment, and on each of the big tables for a groups of eight is
sitting a single person in one corner.

Today will be fairly relaxed with the shortest leg of the vacation and little
elevation gain. Thus, I have enough time for another attempt at fixing my
bicycle. This time I replace the inner tube with a completely new tube to be
sure it will no longer leak air. I do not want to have to patch it up another
time. Because that means in have to remove the rear wheel completely, I also
exchange the brake pads. They did see some good use with the recent downhill
rides. While I could have used them a bit longer, it seems more convenient to
replace them now when I the wheel is removed anyways.

Once I'm done with everything, I have to cycle back to the main route and climb
up the 200m of elevation I lost coming down to Brixen. It turns out to be not as
hard as I imagined coming it down and I am soon back on the main route. The
weather today is really nice and sunny with a few clouds, but not too warm. On
some of the paved patches of the cycle path, lizards are bathing in the sun and
jump away as I approach.

Soon I am at the fortress Franzensfeste. I thought about visiting it, but it is
closed on Mondays like today (and yesterday I was too late). Thus, I only take
a look from the outside. Because this leaves me more time than expected, I take
my time today and cycle with a relaxed speed to take in and really enjoy the
landscape. Also, I developed some knee pain after the climbs of the last two
days, so it might be a good idea to go a bit easy anyways.

The signage of the Munich-Venice cycle route was okay in Germany. In Austria,
you had to know which local cycle routes you are following (though that wasn't
difficult given that you mostly follow the Inn). But since I am in South Tyrol,
the signage is excellent. Sometimes going to the extreme of three signs at
a single turn like in the picture above.

Before Bruneck (or Brunico in Italian) some dark clouds came up with a short
shower. It was so short that unpacking my rain jacket was completely useless and
soon the sun was shining again. In Bruneck, I visit the Messner Mountain Museum
Ripa showcasing the life of various mountain tribes. The exhibits were quite
atmospheric but a bit more information could have been provided. The museum is
housed in the Bruneck castle and you can climb the castle tower to get a nice
view.

After the museum visit, I stock up on food in a supermarket. At the checkout it
turns out that I was expected to weigh the fruits myself. I didn't even think
about that because it has been ages since I was in a supermarket where it is not
done at the cash desk. Unfortunately, the cashier was only speaking Italian
(which I do not speak), but despite that quite friendly and helpful, in contrast
to a French supermarket where the same thing happened to me once. The majority
(about 68%) of the population in South Tyrol speaks German by the way.

The remaining short distance of about 10km to today's destination of Oberolang
goes through more beautiful landscapes in sunny weather.

Today I only cycled 57.3km with a relaxed speed of 14.2km/h in 4 hours.
I reached a maximum speed of 42.7km/h.
