We have another late start because of the rainy weather. But soon the rain
stops. Because we are unsure how quickly the rock will dry (and three people are
still sick and will stay in bed or at least mostly indoors), we decide to do the
Stuller Wasserfall (waterfall) via ferrata. Given a steel cable and some extra
artificial steal rungs, we deem some potential wet spots to be less of an issue
than with actual rock climbing.

With Steffi taking care of small Vincent, it's again only Anna, Alex, and me
heading out. On the approach to the via ferrata, we find a sign that it is
closed, but it is turned around to face away from us. We hope that this means
that it is actually not closed anymore and the sign itself just wasn't
transported away yet.

The via ferrata starts in a narrow crack behind a flake. The first half isn't
super hard (up to difficulty C), but quite enjoyable. There aren't too many
artificial foot holds, some great views, and some technical spots that require
a bit of thinking.

Then we get to the short overhanging crux of difficulty D. Just below is a slab
that is completely wet. It is the only spot where the wetness is a bit of an
issue and one has to be careful not to slip. The overhang afterwards in
conquered quickly and than only easy climbing remains with some nice views of the
waterfall.

After an ascent of about 450m, we reach Stuls and the end of the via ferrata.
From here, we walk back to our starting point in Moos. The full round takes us
about 3:15h with about 30 minutes of approach and 50 minutes walking back.

The via ferrata has also a few alternate routes that are much harder with
difficulties of E or even E/F. Given the potentially wet conditions and not
completely reliable weather today (though much better than expected), we did not
consider doing these variants.

For dinner we got delicious Pizza to celebrate the last day in this vacation
home. Tomorrow we have to move on.
