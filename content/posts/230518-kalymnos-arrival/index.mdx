Today my long awaited climbing vacation on Kalymnos starts. Around noon I meet
with Anna, Antoine, Anja, and Jonas at the Munich airport. There we have to wait
in a quite long queue to check in because the online check-in was not working.
But at least the security check is done quickly.

After an uneventful flight, we arrive in Kos with 40 minutes delay. From there,
we take a cab to Mastihari where a ferry to Kalymnos departs. It isn't
a particular large boat, but quite fast which makes the ride extremely bumpy.
Having survived this, we are dropped off in Pothia, where we walk to our hotel
for the first night. It turns out to be slightly harder than expected to get
there because the streets on Google Maps do not line up with the actual streets.

Once we dropped off our luggage, we look for a place to have dinner. We end up in
a Pizza place, but I would not recommend the Pizza. It has a thick crust, very
little tomato sauce, and a thick layer of cheese. The appetizer, however, was
better: feta cheese with honey and sesame, a local speciality

After dinner it is quite late and time to go to bed.
