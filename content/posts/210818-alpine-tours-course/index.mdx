Some of my friends here in Munich started to do alpine tours (i.e. tours with
glacier travel and usually above 3000m altitude) a little while back. To be able
to join them on these tours I booked a course to gain the necessary knowledge.
At 6am today, I meet with most of the other participants (Christian, Sven, Kira,
Jana, and our instructor Steven) to leave Munich towards the Kaiser
Franz-Josef-Höhe. We drive with two cars, and meet the sixth participant
(Beatrice) there. It is 2:30h to 3h drive with the last bit following a long
and windy mountain toll road.

The Kaiser Franz-Josef-Höhe is a big tourist center, but it is pretty deserted
when we arrive. The only other people there seem to be mountaineers preparing
for their alpine tours. It is quite chilly and I put on a long sleeved base
layer while we wait for the other cars to arrive. Then we start our approach to
the Oberwalder Hütte (Oberwalder hut). The first part goes through some tunnels
before we have to cross a barrier with a warning that the trail thereafter is
restricted to experienced mountaineers.

From there we get a view of the valley that leads to the hut. At this height
there are not many green spots on the glacier carved rock. In the valley we see
the end of a dirty glacier.

Eventually we reach the lower part of a glacier that we need to cross. It is
only a short distance across and safe to cross without crampons or tying into
a rope.

The next challenge is a via ferrata. It is fairly easy (and we do not use via
ferrata kits), but has a somewhat exposed corner which frightened Jana. With
some support she was, nevertheless, brave enough to make it through.

From the top of the via ferrata you get a nice view of the surroundings and it
is only a short walk to the Oberwalder Hütte (2973m). From the Kaiser
Franz-Josef-Höhe we ascended about 670m (and descended about 25m)

After getting comfortable in the hut and eating a Kaspressknödelsuppe (pressed
cheese dumplings in soup), we head out to a nearby glacier to learn how to walk
with crampons and an ice pick.

Unfortunately, Sven is getting a headache and some dizziness
after a while; some light signs of altitude sickness and the physiological
adjustment processes. We bring him back to the hut where he can lie down. The
rest of us is still feeling well enough (Christian also has a headache) and
heads back to the glacier. We learn how to tie into the rope and how
to travel on a glacier. In the meantime, the sky clears up and the weather
becomes beautiful.

Eventually, I also develop a headache. Luckily, we are finished soon and descend
back to the hut at slightly lower altitude where the pain disappears quickly.
Though, I am worried that it will reappear once we ascend again. Especially, as
the plan for tomorrow is to ascend the Johannisberg (3453m) which is much
higher.

We spend the evening practicing knots that we will need in the following days.
