The bad weather is finally over. In fact, we have a sunny day without risk of
thunderstorms presenting ideal conditions for a long tour. Anna, Marcel, and I
decided to do the twenty (!) pitch route Plattenzauber going up the Hintere
Platteinspitze (2723m). Fabian, Marco, and Susanne (who has to depart today) do
the shorter seven pitch route Hepke Vitale close to the cabin.

After a quick breakfast, we start at 6:40am with the approach. Unfortunately, we
miss a branching point and go up part of the descent trail. We need to call back
Anna who is following confidently the GPS track on her phone. Luckily, I was
aware that we still need to cross a ravine. On the way we see two animals that
might have been two young ibex, or maybe just ordinary goats. We are not
entirely sure.

Eventually, we reach the start of the climbing route. Marcel gets to lead
everything as switching leaders takes some time in a three-person multi-pitch
setup. The climbing is really nice and enjoyable, mostly on slightly slabby
walls. The first pitches are traversing a lot to the right before getting
steeper. At one anchor, Marcel forgets his belay device, but luckily it is one
of the steeper pitches, so we can lower him off to grab it and have him climb
up again without too much time loss.

Close to the end, we have a short overhanging traverse and get onto a tower.
From there we can see that two people are just finishing to drill additional
bolts into the last pitch. As it was fairly easy, with just a <Grade
system="UIAA" value="4-" /> spot, it only had two blots so far. But getting some
extra protection for peace of mind is great.

But first, we have to down climb a little bit into a crevice. For one part of the
down climb we discuss for a while whether we need to setup a belay. But it is
easy climbing with a fixed rope installed, so we can eventually come to the
conclusion that it is fine without.

After the last pitch, this isn't done. We still need to climb a bit unprotected
along the ridge line with difficulty up to <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />.
At one spot we are not sure how it continues, but eventually downclimb and
traverse a bit which turns out to be much easier than it looked. And then we are
finally on the summit. The view is great and we take a short break. But we
cannot stay for long as it is less than an hour until dinner is served.

The descent still has some scrambling along fixed ropes before leading to ravine
with a lot of scree that we have to descend through. Once we get back to
a proper path, we are almost running. Surprisingly, we still have that energy
despite the long day. Maybe it is just the dinner motivating us. At 6:40pm we
are back at the cabin. It is a bit too late for the official dinner time, but we
are still served. A great ending to a great day of climbing!
