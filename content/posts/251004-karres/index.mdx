For various reasons, no one seems to have slept very well. So we again stick
with very chill routes. On Tabu <Grade system="UIAA" value="6a+" /> I even have
a slight mental breakdown, but after taking some time, I complete the route and
redpoint it on my second try.

We leave at about 5pm shortly before the rain starts. We have dinner at a Thai
place in Garmisch on the way back.
