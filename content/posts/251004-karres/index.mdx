For various reasons, no one seems to have slept very well. So we again stick
with very chill routes. On Tabu <Grade system="UIAA" value="6a+" /> I even have
a slight mental breakdown, but after taking some time, I complete the route and
redpoint it on my second try.

Between noon and 1pm is an extensive alarm tests with sirens sounding for quite
some time which is a bit annoying. At one point all our phones start beeping
with an alert too, and it is not easy to disable when everyone is either
climbing or belaying.

Also annoying was a Swiss couple (they where there yesterday too). The woman
seems to have a breakdown in every single route and constantly screaming. We are
wondering why she is even climbing as it doesn't sound like she is enjoying it.

We leave at about 5pm shortly before the rain starts. We have dinner at a Thai
place in Garmisch on the way back.
