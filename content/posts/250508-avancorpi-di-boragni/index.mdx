While Antoine takes a rest day and stays home, the rest of us visits Avancorpo
di Boragni. We stick to mostly easy routes for a relaxed day.

<Loc latlong={[44.213084, 8.352269]} zoom={13} />

But I cannot
refrain from trying the <Grade system="french" value="7a" /> variation of Fuori
tema / Another spit in the wall. The main route is <Grade system="french"
value="6b" /> and quite nice. The harder variation goes a bit more directly
through a slight overhang with some separate bolts. I manage to send the route
on my third try. Essentially it is just two hard crux moves: a crossover with
the right to a small crimpy hold, then a bad pinch with your left, and a throw for
an hourglass like hold that forms a pocket for two to three fingers.

We have a pasta dinner in Finale. I order Spaghetti alla carbonara, which is
done properly here with eggs, Pecorino cheese, and definitely no cream.
