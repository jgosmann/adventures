For a training course, I was in Nuremberg and today I spend there another day
sightseeing.

<Loc latlong={[49.4534, 11.077]} />

On my way to the old city core, I pass the opera house. Apparently, it is in
dire need of renovations but the city doesn't have the money.

My actual walk through the old city core starts at the Nuremberg castle.

From here you get also a nice view of the city.

The next stop is the Tiergärtnerplatz with a number of old buildings and the
house of Albrecht Dürer.

The Sebalduskirche (church of Sebaldus) is one of the two major churches in the
city.

Next, I pass through Weißgerbergasse showing how Nuremberg might have looked like,
before major parts of it were destroyed in the Second World War.

Now I cross the river Pegnitz and get a view of the bridge going to the
hangman's house because he was not allowed to live within the city core.

Nearby is also another interesting bridge: the oldest iron suspension bridge in
continental Europe, called the Kettensteg.

Around noon, I make it to the market square with the Schöne Brunnen (“Beautiful
Fountain”) and Frauenkirche (“Church of Our Lady”). Exactly at noon, I can watch
the Männleinlaufen of the mechanical clock of the Frauenkirche, where the clock
mechanism moves around a procession of figurines around the Holy Roman
Emperor.

For lunch, I have some original Nuremberg sausages with sauerkraut and a wheat
beer. Afterwards, I visit the “future museum”, a branch of the famous engineering
and science museum “Deutsche Museum” from Munich. The exhibitions covers
different aspects of how the future could look like based on current scientific
knowledge as well as how it was imagined in science fiction stories. It is quite
well made. They currently have a quite advanced and impressive humanoid robot,
called Ameca, on display. I also like the fall tower where you can trigger some
live free fall experiments yourself.

After leaving the museum, I continue my walk through the Southern part of
Nuremberg's old city core.
