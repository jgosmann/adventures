After breakfast I have to repack my luggage to get it into a somewhat easily
transportable state as I will be moving on later in the day. But I still have
some hours in Seattle that I can use for sightseeing. Peter's dad gave me the
tip that there is sort of an old, unused underground city below the old city
core. So I decid to visit Bill Schneidel's Underground Tour first. It turns
out to be quite interesting while also having a large number of poop jokes and
puns. Apparently, the old sewage system interacted with the tides and could lead
to geysers out of the toilets on high tide. To be able to build a better sewage
system, they built higher streets, but the pedestrian walkways on either side
were still lower and have been covered later (well, it took them 14 years to
complete that work).

Afterwards, I walk around the old city core and Chinatown with some guidance
from a free, self-guided tour available online and some informative plaques
placed on points of interest. I also come along a National Historic Park which
is basically a museum on the Klondike Gold Rush. Because it is free, I visit it
too.

In the afternoon I buy some sandwiches, pick up my luggage from the hostel, and
head to the Greyhound bus terminal. Unfortunately, the bus to Vancouver is
delayed by over an hour. As it will bring us across the Canadian border, we have
to show our passports when boarding and I recognize that there is another German
backpacker on the bus and we have a short chat.

Several hours and an unspectacular border crossing later, I get dropped at the
Pacfic Central Station. I have passed through there twice about two years ago;
it is always a weird feeling to come pack to a place I already visited, but only
once or twice and quite some time ago. It is familiar, but also foreign. From
there I take the Skytrain to the same central Hostel I have stayed in before.
I booked a bed in a 2-person dorm, but get lucky and the other bed stays free,
so essentially I get a private room.
