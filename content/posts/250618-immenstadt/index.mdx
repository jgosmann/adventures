The actual cycling tour starts today. I depart shortly before 9am. The route is
somewhat hilly, but the uphills are quite fine on my new bicycle and the
downhills make even more fun on drop bars.

On the way, I repeatedly see a group of middle aged men on electric mountain bikes all
wearing shirts with printed suspenders of traditional Bavarian leather pants.
I'm faster than they are, but they overtake me when I take breaks. Today's
leg is short and I have to take a forced break to not reach my accommodation
before I am able to check in at 2pm.

Once I unloaded my bicycle at the accommodation, I continue the visitor's centre
of the Nagelfluhkette (the nearby mountain range) with a small exhibition. It is
located next to the Großer Alpsee where I take a swim afterwards. Then I make my
way back to my room for the night, take a shower, and relax the remainder of the
evening on the balcony.

Today I cycled a distance of 66.1km within 3.5 hours, averaging 18.7km/h.
I attained a maximum speed of 51.8km/h on the downhill sections.
