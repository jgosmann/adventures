Fabian and I want to climb the Kreuzwand (2132m) and Viererspitze (2054m) today.
The weather forecast doesn't promise quite stable weather. The night was rainy
and starting in the afternoon there is chance of showers and even thunderstorms.
Thus, doing a multipitch climb, even though I would have liked it, seemed not
a good choice. We do not want to carry all the gear to find wet rock and also do
not want to be stuck in a long multipitch should the weather turn. With lighter
packs and a route that requires climbing only for the last few meters of the
summits, we have more options to react to the weather.

When we leave Munich at 7:13am it is dry, but as we arrive in Mittenwald shortly
before 9am, it is raining lightly. But we are not deterred and trust the weather
forecast. Indeed, the rain soon gets lighter and lighter until it stops
completely. Due to the wetness, we see many salamaders on the trail and
eventually stop counting. We also encounter a snail. And a bit after the
Dammkarhütte (Dammkar cabin), we see some chamois. Quite the zoo here!

After the cabin, we have to ascend a field of scree. We are quite impressed by
how fast the chamois manage to run over it. But luckily it isn't as bad as <Link
to="/posts/230611-breitenkopf/">last year at the Breitenkopf</Link>. There are
areas with larger, pretty stable rocks that we can ascend on quite well.

We make it up the ridge line, turn right and scramble up the Kreuzwand. The rock
is pretty dry by now, so it was good to not be deterred by the rain earlier. On
the summit we have a lunch break and enjoy the view.

As we descend back down, we see two other hikers coming up the scree below. But
they took the left branch around a rock formation instead of the right branch
recommend by my guide book. It looks to be much more effort because it has way
more scree on that side. Nevertheless, they make it up and turn towards
the Kreuzwand, so our paths cross. We continue towards the Viererspitze. At one
spot, the trail is still below a steep snow field. From our vantage point it
didn't even look that steep, but half-way in, the thought that this looks quite
steep and I definitely don't want to slip creeps in. Freaking out isn't helpful,
so I continue to kick in one step after another with my feet and always make
sure that I'm well supported. It is a bit tiring because the snow is frozen hard
in some spots and I can only stand on the front part of my feet, always engaging
my calves. Eventually, I reach the other end and I'm relieved. I'm also happy
that I brought a hiking pole for additional support (exactly in anticipation of
snow fields). Though maybe, I should have taken my ice pick instead (which
I also considered, but is twice as heavy). I don't think it would have made
a difference while being stable, but in case I would have slipped and started
sliding downwards, an ice pick would have allowed me to arrest myself better,
i.e. the safety margin would have been a bit higher.

Continuing a little bit on the ridge line, we reach the final crux. A little bit
of <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" /> climbing. On the Internet, someone said
that it is harder than the <Link to="/posts/210807-hoher-gaif/">Hohe
Gaif</Link>, the route finding can be a bit tricky, and supposedly it is quite
exposed. We found all of that to be mostly untrue utilizing a topo from the
Internet. We had no trouble finding the start of the route and we could follow
the signs of slightly polished rock. Nevertheless, we happened to veer off
for a little bit. It wasn't a huge deal because the climbing was still not
hard and it made us top out at a narrow part of the ridge line with a great
steep view down.

On the summit, we can shortly enjoy the view of Mittenwald before we get
engulfed in a cloud that doesn't seem to be willing to move on. From somewhere
we hear rope commands of some climbers. Deprived of the view, we start to
descent. This time we follow the proper route. As we walk back the ridge line,
we see a climber (with rope) reaching the summit of the Viererspitze. That
explains the rope commands. That climbing route is probably fun too, but given
the weather forecast, we still consider our decision for today's tour to be the
right one.

Crossing the snow field the second time turns out to be much easier. Of course,
we already have steps, but the snow has gotten a little bit softer by now
(without turning into slush) and provides a bit more grip.

Descending through the scree back to the Dammkarhütte is also much more pleasant
than going up. On the way, we see some more climbers on the Kreuzwand. They are
also quite well to hear with the sound being reflected from the opposing rock
faces.

By now the weather is quite sunny and much better than we expected. Via the
Ochsenboden we descend back to Mittenwald where we manage to catch a train back
with just a few minutes to spare. In total (without breaks) we were hiking for
six hours and covered an elevation difference of 1400m.
