Given the good weather, we were hoping to have another day of climbing together
after our South Tyrol vacation got cut short. But several people were still not
feeling fit enough, and other people were too tired (partially because staying
up late in the hope to see the Aurora Borealis given the recent geomagnetic
storm, but without much success). So, in the end, it was just Anna and me
heading to Flintsbach. In addition, the train schedule wasn't quite regular: we
had to take the S-Bahn to Grafing because the train was not departing at the
stations in the city center. This added about 30 minutes to the otherwise an
hour long ride.

But from the train station in Flintsbach it is just a short walk to the shady
crag. After some warm up routes, I get onto Animals <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7+" />, one of the crag's classics. I am happy that I manage to onsight
it. The crux is a technical section with good underclings, but polished feet.
I had to be careful with the direction of force through my feet such that they
do not slip. Afterwards, you get a good rest spot where you essentially can sit
down, followed by a cool overhang on really good jugs. The only difficulty is
that you have to reach quite far for one of them. I was barely able to reach it
statically. Anyone with a shorter reach probably needs to jump for it.

Next I want to do Sacklaus <Grade system="UIAA" value="7" />, but after getting
onto a ledge, the next bolts are a bit hidden behind a corner to the left, while
on the right there are some other bolts in a logical line close by. Thus, I end
up getting into Milchm√§dchen <Grade system="UIAA" value="8" /> and wonder why it
is so hard. But with a few breaks in the rope, I somehow manage to get to the
top. I then try the actual Sacklaus, but it also turns out to be not that easy.
Maybe I'm also just tired from the hard route before. Anyway, I end up
just hangdogging this route as well.
