I did not find a climbing partner with compatible time constraints for this
weekend, so I decided to do a via ferrata on my own instead. Germany is in the
middle of a heat wave right now, which made me chose the North-West exposed
Fingersteig (difficulty D). I actually wanted to do this ferrata already <Link
to="/posts/200912-tegelbergsteig">last fall</Link>, but got stuck in the
Tegelbergsteig (C). Unfortunately, I am even more constrained for time today due
to an appointment, I need to be back home for in time.

Like last time, I first ascend to the Gelbe Wand Steig (A). I see less people
than last time, and the first part of the Gelbe Wand Steig to the start of the
Tegelbergsteig has very little traffic. I probably saw more cows, seeking the
shade, than people.

I get hopeful that I might be able to do the Tegelbergsteig _and_ the Fingersteig
today. But than there is a long queue for the Tegelbergsteig again. I decide to
join it and see how fast it moves. Time for a second breakfast and to
enjoy the view.

But after twenty or thirty minutes, I realize that I will not be able to
do both ferratas today with my time constraint. Time for plan B: Pass the queue,
run up the Gelbe Wand Steig (that I also already did <Link
to="/posts/201013-branderschrofen/">last year with my parents</Link>), and make
it to the top in half the time given in the guide books.

From there, I have to pass over a saddle and descent a little bit. Thanks to
my last attempt, I now know where to look for the right trail and do not miss it.
From there you get a good view of the “finger” which I will climb partially in
the first part of the Fingersteig.

The first part is quite steep (slightly overhanging), but gives good views.
There are a lot of paragliders because the Tegelberg is a popular launch spot
for them.

Within the via ferrata are some plaques, highlighting some artefacts of early
alpine climbing.

After the first part on the “finger”, the via ferrata transitions onto the
“main“ wall. From here you get another nice view.

The next challenge is an overhanging part without any artificial steps. Not that
easy! But after identifying the foot holds, it is quickly surmounted. And then,
some more steep terrain awaits.

But first, I write into the “summit book” (in via ferratas it is not actually on
the summit, but in the middle of the route). This also means selfie time.
Traditionally, they have been used as aid in rescue operations (I think) to know
whether a person did make it to the summit before going missing. Because I am
alone today, it will not hurt to let others know that I at least made it up to
here. There is only single other entry for today, and from the previous pages
it seems that only a couple of people do this ferrata each day. Completely
different than the congested Tegelbergsteig!

At the final part, I finally lay eyes on the two other people in front of me.
I heard their sounds every now and then for a while already. But I did not see
a single person in the via ferrata until now.

The view from here and finally the top is excellent again.

The it is time to descent. On the way down, I get another good view of the via
ferrata I just did.

Once again, I am much faster than the guide books said and have to wait an hour
for my bus back. Nevertheless, I have a fun time. Nearby are a few slack lines
that I make use of. There is also a small water basin where I can put in my feet
and legs to cool them on this hot day.
