For some reason I decided that I want to cycle from Munich to Venice across
the Alps. To avoid the worst mass of tourist, I chose to do it early in May
starting now. Unfortunately, the weather forecast does not look good for the
first few days and I am having second thoughts whether going up all those
mountains might not just be arduous and no fun at all. But now it is too late
to draw back.

I leave around 9:30am, a little bit later than I intended. But I just remembered
that it might be a good idea to top up the tires with some more air one last
time before I leave. Luckily, I have some leeway by starting directly from my
front door with no train or airplane to catch.

My first stop is the Marienplatz. It is a slight detour, but to me this mark
of the city center is the proper starting place of this bike ride. My guide book
puts the official start at the central station. However, you'd have to push the
bike from there to the Marienplatz through the pedestrian area and thus I skip
this part.

From Munich there are two options. I decided for the West variant which follows
the river Isar and looked nicer to me. Up to the Lake Sylvenstein it actually
follows the same route I <Link to="/posts/210508-isarradweg/">I cycled a year
earlier in the opposite direction on a day trip</Link>.

Soon the first climb awaits to get onto a high bridge to cross the Isar.
Doable, but will I manage much longer climbs with the heavy panniers on my back
wheel? At least for now I can enjoy a nice view over the Isar.

The joy does not last for long. Coming of the bridge, the motion of my bicycle
suddenly feels weird. I look back down at my rear wheel and confirm my worst
suspicion: I have a flat tire before I even managed to really leave Munich.

But cussing won't help and at least it is not raining yet. Also, a flat tire is
bound to happen on any multi-day cycling tour. That is some sort of natural law,
isn't it? So better to get over with it early and be done with it for the rest
of the vacation (that is how it works? Is it?).

So I flip over my bike on a nearby bench, so I at least don't have to get
everything muddy, and get to work. I patch the tube and remove a tiny piece of
glass from the tire. I should have checked my tire beforehand for such things.
It probably has been in there for a while and now finally pierced the inner
tube under the additional load of my luggage.

As I continue, it still is not really raining. But as you move, you collect the
moisture out of the air and the faster you go, the wetter it seems to get.
Nevertheless, I make it soon to Grünwald where the first downhill ride of the
tour awaits me. On my day trip last year I had to climb the steep incline on
a gravel road and found it to be quite strenuous. But this time I can enjoy it
just rolling down.

I continue along the Isar. I pass a couple of large floats with people under
tents on it. Sadly, I didn't stop to take a picture. After 40km I have a short
break to eat a bit. Incidentally, it happens to be at exactly the same bench
where I made a break a year ago when riding along the Isar in the other
direction. This time, however, I'm not lingering around for long because without
pedalling the bike it starts to get cold and the weather is not inviting today.

At some places along the route, you can find information boards about the cycle
route and the nearby places. Given the weather, I do not really read them
though. Especially, as eventually the first real showers start. Despite all
adversity, I do take a small detour in Bad Tölz to look at a house where the
famous writer Thomas Mann has lived. While I am using a GPS device with a track
of the main route for most navigation needs, I attempt using Google Maps on my
smartphone for this detour which is not included in the GPS track. For some
reason I get routed via some sets of stairs. Not quite ideal with a loaded
touring bike. Somehow a still managed to get to the house and to find a better
way back.

Still around Bad Tölz, I find a roofed area, where I have another break. It
turns out to be good timing because at the same time a really heavy rain shower
starts which has turned back to light rain before I continue. However, as I want
to continue, I notice that my rear tire has lost air again. That's not good!
But I do not want to patch the tube again or replace it. So I decide to just
pump in some more air and see how long it lasts. I have to do this a couple more
times today, but at least the loss of air is slow enough that I can make
progress. Nevertheless, I will have to fix this before tomorrow's leg.

The weather changes between more and less rain. Thus, every now and then I have
to stop to change how much rain gear I'm wearing. In light rain it is more
comfortable without rain pants (because the sweat accumulates in them), but in
heavy rain they are required if I want to avoid getting soaked. It is at least
a bit consoling that I am not the only rider in these conditions. Over the day,
three other touring cyclists pass me going into the opposite direction.

Eventually, I make it to the Lake Sylvenstein. This is where the route departs
from what I rode in the previous year. It is also where the Western and Eastern
variant of the Munich-Venice route join back together. Here the route follows
a big road for a short while. Here at least one good aspect of the bad weather
shows. There are almost no people visiting and the road is pretty quiet. Still
one car passes me way too close (German law requires a 2 meter minimum distance
outside of residential areas now). I meet the drivers a short while later
enjoying the view. Apparently it was a student driver and the teacher ensures me
that he was aware of the close pass and did steer to the left.

The weather does give the lake an interesting atmosphere with the low hanging
clouds around the mountains.

After the Lake Sylvenstein, I could have continued on the road as a shortcut and
to avoid some additional climbs. Ignorant about what is to come, I follow the
official route away from the road. That official route goes over gravel roads,
that are in parts much more pebble roads. In my lowest gear I fight the
inclines. Somehow I manage to get up. Only in a single sport I have to dismount
shortly. The work is not completely wasted as get some nice views of the
Walchenklamm (a gorge).

A short while later I reach the Austrian border, a first milestone for me. But
still a few kilometers short of my destination Achenkirch for today. And
in-between the route takes a detour of the main road for a 100m (or more) climb
of a steep hill on the gravel road. Somehow also that hill is surmounted,
followed with a nice downhill ride. A little bit further and I arrive at my
destination. Two women, also on bicycles, arrive at the same time. At least I am
not the only person that had to endure today's hard ships. It turns out they are
travelling the same route from Munich to Venice as I am, but they took the
Eastern variant and are travelling in a more relaxed speed, spending two days
for what I just did in a single day.

Finally I can take a hot shower (I was really looking forward to this moment).
My panniers got pretty dirty on the wet and muddy gravel roads. Because they
are waterproof, I just take them with me into the shower to clean them.
Originally, I intended to just eat from the provisions that I brought from
Munich. But given that it was a hard day, and I only had short breaks due to the
weather, where I did not have time to eat a lot, and thus I am starving now, I
decide to reward myself by eating out in a nearby Pizza place.

Today I cycled 115km in 6:41h which gives an average speed of 17.2km/h.
I reached a maximum speed of 46.2km/h.
