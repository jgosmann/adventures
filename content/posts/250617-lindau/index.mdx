Today I embark on a week-long cycling trip from the Lake Constance to the
Königssee. Because I still had to run a bunch of errands at home, I only catch
the train at 2:20pm with a 3 minute transfer time, but it works out well and
I arrive at 5pm in Lindau at the Lake Constance.

<Loc latlong={[47.55151, 9.6932]} />

First, I check in at the youth hostel (only one other person is staying with me
in the dorm room), and then go for a stroll through the old city core on the
Lindau island.
