To make use of the relaxed Covid-19 regulations, before the next wave with the
Delta variant hits, I decided together with Vroni, Frederic, Jade, and Vesna
to have a short, five day vacation in the Fontainebleau forest, renown among
rock climbers for its boulders.

We leave early, quarter to seven, from the Munich Central Station with the
french high speed train TGV. After stopping in some other German cities, it
crosses the French border to Strasbourg. From there, it goes non-stop to Paris
in just about 90 minutes with over 300km/h. The whole trip takes less than six
hours. It is quite relaxed and we sit around a table, talk, and play
games.

Around 12:30pm, we arrive in the Gare de Paris-Est station. While Jade meets up
with an old acquaintance, the rest of us needs to get to the Gare de Lyon to
pick up a rental car. What should be a simple trip with the Métro, turns into
a bit of an odyssey. First, we have to wait quite some time (estimated 30
minutes) in line to get tickets to the Métro. For some reason there seem to be
only two ticket machines in this central transportation hub. If we had known
this, we would have bought tickets already in the bistro on the TGV instead of
having been lazy when they announced this option on the train.

At the Châtelet station we have to change Métro trains. It is quite busy and it
takes a while for all the people to get off our next train before we can enter.
At this station, as in most (all?) central Métro stations, the platforms are
separated with a barrier from the railway tracks and the doors open only after
a train has stopped. As I am about to finally enter, the doors close suddenly
and quickly without any warning, or at least without warning audible among the
background noise. My left leg gets caught in-between the train doors, while the
outer platform doors crush against my head, throwing off my glasses that
I somehow manage to save with a hand.

Unlike most German subway train doors, the Métro doors are merciless. They
do not open a tiny bit again. I feel stuck for some moments, but then somehow
manage to free my foot and the rest of my body. Black rubber marks are now on
my pant leg and I will have a (non-visible, but perceptible) bruise on my
cheek bones for the next days.

The amazing thing about the Paris Métro, though, is that another train departs
every three minutes. So I can just take the next train after a short wait to
catch up to my friends who made it into the previous train.

On to the next part of the odyssey: finding the Avis car rental. From the online
reservation we only know that it is somewhere in the train station. It is
a large train station. First we try Google Maps, but it just leads us to the
main hall. Then we look at the textual address given on Google Maps: hall 3,
niveau -1. So we walk back to hall 3 (where we came from), don't find anything,
look at the map and figure out that there is a separated part under hall 1 that
also counts as hall 3. Thus, we walk back there and find the location where the
Avis office used to be with some french directions and a map to the new location
in the hall we came from. It highlights the elevator next to the McDonald's. We
walk back to hall 3 for the third time. The McDonald's and some elevators next
to it are easily found. Just no car rental in sight. Nearby is also an exit to
the train station and in front of that exit are some more elevators; even with
signs of car rental companies. However, there is no way to operate these
elevators without some sort of access card for the parking garage. So we
continue to wander about and ask some people who either don't speak English,
don't know where the car rental is, or both. Finally, we discover that all the
way left of the outside elevators there is another elevator (and stairs) hidden
that actually bring us to the park deck with the car rental agencies. There we
have to wait for quite some more time before we can finally pick up the car and
have to pay a substantial amount extra for being “late”. Our mood hits rock
bottom.

Next we pick up Jade and have a rather uneventful drive South to our Airbnb in
Noisy-sur-École. Our hosts are friendly and speak quite good English.

After unloading our luggage, we do a grocery run in Milly-la-Forêt. Afterwards,
we enjoy coffee and cider at a local bar.

Back from the grocery run, we pick up one of the Fontainebleau maps showing the
boulder fields in the forest, get some recommendations from our host, and head
into the forest. It is not more than a 20 minute walk until we hit the first
boulders. After playing around on one of them for a few minutes, we head to the
next boulder field which provides an incredible selection of all difficulties.
We boulder there as long as we can to still get back in daylight. By being so
far West, but still in the same timezone, the sun does not set until about 10pm.
Life is now much better than just a few hours earlier!

Then we had back to our Airbnb, eat, and go to sleep.
