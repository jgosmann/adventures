Today I visit the island of Murano. Due to the fire danger, all glassblowers of
Venice had to move there. To get to the vaporetto stop, I walk through some more
parts of San Marco. On the ride to the island, I also pass the small island with
the cemetery of Venice.

On Murano are even more shops selling local glassware than in other parts of
Venice. I visit a glassblowing demonstration. For some steps the master calls
his assistant Beppe who seems a bit inattentive. When holding the half-finished
vase into the oven to keep the glass hot enough, he messes up. The glass gets
too soft and deforms. Now the master has to improvise to save the work.

Now it is almost noon and I am hungry. I decide to eat at the Osteria al
Duomo which apparently is owned cooperatively by 50 families from Murano. There
I can sit in a nice courtyard. I start my meal with marinated salmon, continue
with tagliatelle with scampi and asparagus, and finish it off with tiramisu.
All of it is very delicious.

Afterwards I visit the Basilica dei SS Maria e Donato just across the bridge
from the osteria.

I then return to more central Venice and stop at the Ocean Space which has
two art installations in a former church. The installations relate to the ocean
and the effects of climate change.

My next stop is the Basilica di San Marco. Today I am wearing long pants which
satisfy the dress code (knees should be covered) to visit the interior with its
impressive golden mosaics all over the ceilings. The guidebook said the entrance
is free, but pretty much everything was slightly more expensive by now than the
guidebook stated. Same for the Basilica. The initial entrance is €3. But to also
see the Pala d'Oro you have to pay again and slightly more: €5 this time. Then
finally, to get into the attached museum and onto the Loggia, they raise the
stakes again and you have to pay another €7.

So far I haven't got a view of Venice from a high point. The obvious possibility
is the bell tower of the Basilica right here at the Piazza San Marco. However,
it closes pretty soon and there is usually quite the line. Instead, I take the
vaporetto across the channel to San Giorgio. The bell tower there is open for
longer, cheaper, less crowded, and probably gives the more interesting view of
San Marco. In the distance, I can also see the Alps. Seeing them like this, it is
almost hard to believe that I crossed them with my bicycle.

Once I am satiated by the view, I take a short look into the church of San
Giorgio itself.

Then I look around on the island a bit more and stumble into two free art
exhibitions. One is showing works of artists working with fire (e.g. by Alberto
Burri), the other one is showing design works of the glass manufacturer
FontanaArte.

To end the day, I have a Spritz and some Cicheti. I was wondering whether they
only say Spritz in Venice and not Aperol Spritz like in Germany. Turns out they
let you chose the liquor and if you take, for example, Campari it is a Campari
Spritz, not an Aperol Spritz. Maybe I should have tried some new combination,
but end up getting a “classic” Aperol Spritz. It is really good. I'm not sure
whether it is just the nice ambience, or whether they really make a better
Spritz in Venice. For desert I get gelato from Suso where they offer interesting
flavors like walnut with figs.

Because my three-day vaporetto ticket expired by now, I walk back to the bicycle
parking and then ride back to the hotel. With my bicycle I rode 19.8km in 54
minutes. This gives an average speed of 22km/h. My maximum speed were 30km/h.
