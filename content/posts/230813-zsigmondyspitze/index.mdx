At quarter to seven, we leave the hut and start our ascent of the
Zsigmondyspitze (3089m). At a fork, that we will return to later, we leave some
of our stuff to have less to carry up. But as I am still carrying the rope it
barely affects the felt weight of the backpack.

After crossing a field of scree, we reach the start of the climbing where we
gear up. The first few pitches are easy; graded not above <Grade system="UIAA"
value="3" />. Thus, we decide to simul-climb, i.e. climbing at the same time
with a few pieces of protection between us. This allows us to move faster. There
are a few bolts, but we also places slings and nuts as protection.

In one spot, where a bolt should have been, I cannot find it. But then
I remember my experience from the <Link
to="/posts/210912-bw3-adamplatte/">Alpspitze</Link>, double check the topo and
see that it should be behind me, which is exactly the place where I find it.
Sometimes learning from mistakes works indeed.

Before the last rope length, we have to decide between the easy variant
graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" /> or the more difficult direct route graded <Grade
  system="UIAA"
  value="4"
/>
. After short discussion we decide for the latter. For this, we finally switch
to an actual belay.

After a lunch break, we descent back down. Partially we down climb and partially
we rappel.

Back at the fork, we pick up our remaining gear and start to ascend the ridge
line again towards the Northern Mörchenscharte (2872m). There we cross the ridge
line and descent about 1100m on the other side into the Floiten valley. It seems
like a quite long and never ending descent.

But even the longest descent eventually ends. In this case at an alpine stream
that we need to cross. This turns out to be not the easiest task. It is cut
quite deep into the scree and the opposite side is a steep one meter high step
of loose sand and pebbles. After managing this hurdle, another 400m ascent to
the Greizer Hütte (2227m) awaits us. At this point I'm quite tired and I have to
push myself to make it up there. <Link
to="/posts/200314-nagelfluhkette/">Ascents after a long day are really the
worst.</Link> Fabian doesn't show any sign of weakness and is ahead despite the
weight of the rope that he has been carrying since we came down from the summit.

The hut is quite busy and we can barely squeeze onto a table for dinner. The
hut's offerings are completely vegetarian. We have Kaspressknödel and
sauerkraut. Tired from the 9:15h of hiking and climbing (discounting the lunch
break), 1700m ascended, and 1550m descended, we go to bed shortly after.
Unfortunately and despite being extremely tired, I don't sleep well.
