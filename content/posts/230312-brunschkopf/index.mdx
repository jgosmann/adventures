This year, at the company's winter retreat, I am organizing a little snow shoe
hike onto the Brunschkopf (1513m). Unfortunately, there is only little snow.
Along the first part from the hotel to Wildmoos, the remaining snow is packed
and it just does not make sense to wear snow shoes. For the final ascent it is
possible use snow shoes, but not really necessary. I keep mine off and just
carry them around.

On the summit, we have a lunch break and then continue on to the Möserer lake.
It still has a thin ice cover, but probably not for long. Today's temperature
has clearly risen above freezing and melting snow is dripping onto us from the
surrounding trees.

From there it goes back to hotel. We pass one spot where we get a good view of
the hotel.

After about 4 hours at around 2pm we get back to the hotel for a relaxed
afternoon. We covered a distance of about 12 to 13km and an elevation difference
of 400m. (Note that first part of the GPS track is wildly off and missing
a part. From Wildmoos on it is accurate.)

And to finish this post off, the great view from my hotel room later in the afternoon:
