The weather is even worse today and we do not expect to find any dry rock all
day. Thus, we drive to the city of Fontainebleau. First we have coffee and tea
there and walk a little bit through the city core.

Then we visit the local climbing shop. Jade buys new climbing shoes, Frederic
new approach shoes.

Then we try to get lunch, but it is almost 3pm and most restaurants are either
closed at this time or only provide drinks. But eventually we find a place with
excellent food and pastries. The waiter lived for a few years in the UK and
speaks excellent English with a British accent. Also, his service is very
professional and leaves nothing to desired. Stuffed from the meal, I take my
dessert, a Pain au Chocolat, with me. It is really delicious when I eat it
later.

The evening is spent with packing, cleaning, and board games. Unfortunately,
this was our last day and we leave tomorrow morning.
