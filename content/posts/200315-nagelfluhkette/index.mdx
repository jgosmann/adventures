At the Staufner Haus breakfast is offered already at 7am, so we decided to wake
up 30 minutes earlier today and have breakfast already at 7:30am. Then it is
time to put the snow shoes back on and start a short ascent of about 200m to the
first summit of today's ridge line, the Hochgrat (1832m). From there we will
traverse again the ridge line, hitting multiple peaks along the way, and then
descending back to Immenstadt after climbing the Stuiben.

It is sunny and warm all day. Occasionally we have to put on a jacket in shady
or windy places, but most of the day we spend in t-shirts, even on the snow.
That is a bit surreal and at times makes us feel as if we were climbing sand
dunes at a beach. By traversing the ridge line, we get also a great view in all
directions the whole day. To our right, we have the snowy Alps where it is still
a winter-vibe, but to our left the mountains are smaller and everything looks
like spring.

At one point we have to descend a quite steep slope of at least 35Â°. That is
quite fun. Though, at one point I start sliding faster than anticipated, lose my
balance, slide into Kristina, and take her off her feet too. Good thing that the
snow is soft. For the remaining descent we leave a bit more distance between us.

Depending on the exposure to sun, the snow cover varies widely. That means we
have to repeatedly take off or put on our snow shoes. While we get increasingly
efficient doing this, I am definitely happy to have bought a new backpack for
the trip. With my old backpack attaching snow shoes was always a bit
complicated, but the new backpack has compression straps on the backside that
I can use to fasten the snow shoes to the pack easily.

The avalanche risk is quite low this weekend, but eventually we get to a spot
where we are happy about our avalanche training. Where our path should have
been, snow slid off of the wet grass. It seems to steep and dangerous to cross
that part and we cannot see the official trail. Thus, we decide it is better to
descend a bit and ascend again past that stretch. However, the slope next to the
avalanche area is still quite steep. The snow cover does not look deep, but it
is hard to tell from just looking and is probably much thicker than it looks (as
we notice later it is really thick). Thus, while the avalanche risk low and the
snow appears to be quite sticky and stable, it definitely means we have to
descend across terrain that is more prone to avalanches. Thus, we decide to do it
one by one with large distances in-between. That way we put less force on the
snow and if one of us happens to trigger an avalanche, the others will hopefully
not be caught in it and can save the unlucky person. In the end, no avalanche
occurs, but better to be safe than sorry.

Our final summit of the day is the Stuiben. We consider descending on the other
side to Immenstadt, but it is unclear how safe the trail is without crampons
(snow shoes might be to unwieldy). Also, we have already hiked quite a bit and
with starting exhaustion or decreasing concentration it might become even more
risky. Thus, we backtrack a little bit and descend the easier trail from the
side that we approached on. There is a train back to Munich at 5pm that we want
to get. It is not the last train by far, but a very convenient connection. Thus,
despite all the distance we have already covered today, we move quite fast.
After about a third, we reach a forest road that is still covered in snow for
a good part, which actually makes for a good descent (without snow shoes). The
snow dampens the impact and lets us slide a little bit with each step. This way
we can cover some of the distance more quickly than on solid ground. Our hiking
poles help us to the keep balance while sliding and running down the mountain.
In the end we catch the train with 6 minutes to spare. Good timing!

Today we did another 19km, ascended 1050m, and descended a whopping 1800m. It
took us a bit under 8 hours. For some reason, it did exhaust me way less than
the prior day. Maybe because the ascents were distributed over multiple smaller
ascents instead of one big one at the end of the day. Or maybe just because
I slept better in the night.

All in all a great weekend with a great mix of wintery snow shoeing and normal
hiking in sunny and warm spring weather. It will be a memory to cherish for
a while given the current pandemic situation. The mountain huts had to close the
day after our return.
