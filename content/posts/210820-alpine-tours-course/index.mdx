According to the weather forecast we have a 70% probability of thunderstorms
today. Thus, we “sleep in” until 6:45am, with breakfast at 7am. The plan for
today is to practice more crevasse rescue techniques close to the hut. Despite
the forecast, we get greeted with a beautiful sunrise and sunny weather all
day.

At 8am we walk a little bit towards the Mittlere Bärenkopf (“bear head in the
middle“) and start practicing the second crevasse rescue technique using an
improvised pulley on flat ground.

Later on, we move even farther towards the Mittlere Bärenkopf where we find
a suitable actual crevasse to practice pulling someone out. Each of us takes
turns in each position. This each one is hanging in the crevasse once.

Looking at the surrounding glaciers, it is quite astounding how much their
appearance changed over the last two days. Because of the good weather, the snow
cover melted and the dirty ice and crevasses below have become much more
visible.

Eventually, another group frees a large ice cliff. There, Steven shows
us some self-rescue techniques that I partially already know from rock climbing.

Then we head back to the hut, where we have a little theory lesson about alpine
dangers and planning of tours. Our task for the evening is to plan the tour for
the following day. We discuss multiple options, but only one is reasonable. We
already were on the Johannisberg, the Fuscherkarkopf would include a long
stretch of rock climbing along a ridge with some <Grade system="UIAA" value="2"
/> spots (not everyone is as much a rock climber as I am), and the Mittlere
Bärenkopf has very little glacier in-between the hut and the summit. Thus, the
only remaining option of a reasonable easy alpine glacier tour is the Hohe
Riffl. We discuss a few more details before going to bed.
