Today our climbing trip to Finale Ligure starts. Around noon we fill the trunk
of Anja's and Jonas's car to the brim. Then all five of us (Anna, Antoine, and
me in addition) squeeze into the car before starting the long drive. Our goal
for today is to make about half of the distance until Bardolino at the Lake
Garda.

A couple hours later with some short stops in-between and some rotations who
gets which seat in the car, we arrive in Bardolino. First, we inspect the flat
that we rented for the night. There is nothing to complain about, but in one of
the hallways of the building, we discover that Italian standards for electrical
wiring might be a bit more lax.

After a short walk along the lakeside and a stroll through the city core, we get
pizza for dinner.

Back at our flat, we play a round of [the game
Set](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1198/set) before going to bed.
