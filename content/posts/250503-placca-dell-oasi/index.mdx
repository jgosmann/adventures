Our crag choice for today fell on Placca dell'oasi. While we had warm and
sunny weather so far, it is cloudy and cooler today. After some warm ups, I get
on Grigio perla <Grade system="french" value="6b" />. The route has a quite
crimpy and a bit technical start, before getting easier. I can send it on my
second try. The next route, Balance <Grade system="french" value="6a+" />, is
also quite technical in the crux and takes a while to figure out, but I manage
to flash it.

Then, I try Nosce te ipsoum <Grade system="french" value="6b+" />. However, the
climbing of the past days (especially trying Galactic Mantra yesterday) have
taken the toll and the skin on my hands is extremely painful. It takes a lot of
cursing, screaming, and sitting in the rope for me to get up there. After that
I start one more route, Scroc <Grade system="french" value="6b" />, but is is so
painful that I bail after the first few moves.

As we return home, Marco arrives, who will join us for the remainder of the
vacation. We decide to have the first dinner with him at the Rookie Osteria.
This is the place where we were standing in front <Link
to="/posts/250427-finale-ligure/">when we were recommended the other traditional
place on the first evening</Link>. The food is still good and I have some
Brandacujun (a mix of potatoes and fish) and some Gnocchi.

<Nextday />
