We have a very relaxed start into the day (as relaxed as it can be if breakfast
time ends at 8am). Anna and Marcel decide go down to Imst to visit a bouldering
gym and hike back up afterwards. As the rains gets less and stops, the rest of
us starts hiking to the Vordere Platteinspitze (2562m). Sometimes we still have
short, light showers, but generally the weather slowly improves.

As we get above the tree line, the rock formations of conglomerate become quite
unique and alien-looking. At one spot the trail markings are not quite clear and
we end up climbing through a groove of that conglomerate rock. Then we realize our
mistake and have to down climb it, staying focussed to not slip. As we get close
to the summit some more scrambling and easy climbing awaits us, before we can
enjoy a nice view in the now even somewhat sunny weather.

After we descended back to cabin, we still have about three hours until dinner
and decide to go back to the nearby Guggerköpfle for some quick sport climbs.
Susanne decides on the way that she prefers to relax and turns around, back to
the hut. So Marco, Fabian, and I find two dry routes and climb them. They turn
out to feature nice climbing.
