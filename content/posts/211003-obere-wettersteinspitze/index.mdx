This Sunday we have [Föhn winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foehn_wind), which
means it gets once more quite warm, maybe the last summer-like day this year.
This weather has to be used! I leave Munich shortly after 7am with a train to
Mittenwald.

I first have to walk through Mittenwald which has a nice city core. Turns out
that it is also quite windy with some storm like gusts. Not necessarily
surprising with Föhn weather. Luckily, it is a quite warm wind and the ascent
will be mostly in the wind shadow.

The first part is along paved roads and wide trails. Some leaves are already
turning yellow and red. Sure signs that summer is coming to an end. But fall
might be the most beautiful season in the mountains.

Then the trail gets narrower and leads through forest above the Lauter See/lake
and Ferchensee (“Ferchen lake”) before it gets finally quite steep and some more
difficult passages (partially secured with a steel rope) follow.

Eventually, I reach the Gamsjoch, a plateau before the final part consisting out
of easy climbing (<Grade system="UIAA" value="1" />) begins.

Shortly before the summit of the Obere Wettersteinspitze (“upper weather stone
peak”, 2297m), I leave the wind shadow and get hit full on by the wind. Time to
put on some layers, but with those it is actually pretty comfortable
temperature-wise. I have a lunch break on the summit. I took about 2:45h to get
up here, which is much less than was given on the signs (4:45h) or in my guide
book (4:15h).

I descend the same way I came up.

For the last part, I do not take the direct route. I have enough time and take
the trail to the shore of the Ferchensee. Along the trail I find a wooden
throne carved out of a large tree stump.

After a break at the Ferchensee, I continue on easy paths to the Lauter See and
along the Lainbach. It has some beautiful waterfalls that I did not know about.

Back in Mittenwald, I still have about a half hour before the train back to
Munich departs. I get some delicious ice cream to kill the time and celebrate
the potentially last warm day of the year.

The descent took me a little bit over two hours. In total, I ascended and
descended 1400m of elevation.
