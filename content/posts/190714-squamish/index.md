While Vera and Christine have another day of sport climbing, I decide to add
some variety and go bouldering with Olivia and Esti before they go back to
Vancouver. After picking up crash pads from JC, a friend of Olivia, we head to
the boulder fields below the Chief.

We warm up on Slingshot, a crimpy V2, that turns out to be a quite hard warm up.
Next we try Poached (V2), traversing on a lip before pulling up onto the
boulder. Unfortunately, I am always too pumped when getting to the spot where
I have to pull up over the lip. A shorter problem with the same top out, called
Left Brain (also V2), is much easier. To this shorter problem exists a lower
start bumping the grade to V3 which I do with a cool bat hang. Not sure if that
was the intended beta, but I definitely started with both hands on the start
hold (and my feet above my head) and could climb it that way.

Two other climbers come by and try the same problem before we move on to the
next boulder. There I climb Anatomy Lesson (V3) which takes quite a while to
figure out as the right beta and body positioning is quite important on quite
slopy holds and bad feet. We then insert some easier boulder problems: Squamish
Days (V0, flash), Squamish Days Traverse (V2, though we did not start it
correctly as I later figured out), and Broken Nose (V2). To finish of the day,
we climbed American Gigolo (V3) which is also a bit beta heavy and has a bad
pinchy, slopy start hold that you really need to squeeze.

Overall the grading felt quite stiff. I am not sure whether that is just because
we are unused to the local climbing style. Nevertheless, I quite enjoyed the
bouldering here. I find bouldering on granite much more enjoyable than on lime
stone as the holds tend to be not as sharp. Though, the roughness of the stone
will wear down the skin over time.

Before heading back to the campsite, we visit downtown Squamish. Apparently,
there is a street festival with live music going on. I try to get postcards, but
Squamish is not touristy at all, and the only place selling post cards (the
Squamish Adventure Centre gift store and the post office) are already closed.

Back at the campsite, we pass the time with a bit of slacklining while waiting
for Vera and Christine before Olivia and Esti are headed back to Vancouver.
