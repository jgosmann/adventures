Today we meet up again with Susi and JÃ¶rg at 9am. We take the ferry to the
neighbouring small island Telendos. It drops us and a bunch of other climbers
off at a dock improvised with a few old tires hanging from some rocks.

After a short approach, we are at Pescatore, the first sector today, where we
warm up. We get a nice, tranquil view as almost no human structures are visible
from here. There is also no noise of scooters that you often get on Kalymnos.
(In fact, there are no motorized vehicles at all on this island.)

After a few routes, Susi convinces me to try the route OTR <Grade value="7a"
system="french" /> with her. It can be described accurately as tufa wrestling
with a finish an smaller and sharper holds. I climb it first and it seems quite
hard. But Susi finds some more really good holds on her try that allow for
a good rest. On my second try, my pulse and breathing quickly rise, but somehow
I manage to remember and execute the essential pieces of beta, all while
constantly being close to be out of breath, but still holding it together and
getting the sent. That makes me quite happy!

This video of Susi's second try gives some impression of the climb.
Unfortunately, she did not sent it.

After that, we do a few more easier climbs (OTR did tire me!) at the Irox. One of
the routes is Hasapiko <Grade value="6a+" system="french" /> which has
a bouldery start and gets easier after that. Antoine and me coach Anna a little bit
on it and after a few tries she manages to send it.

Then the ferry brings us back to Telendos. Shortly after the ferry departs
another boat arrives and the captains have some dispute. Is one stealing the
customers from the other?

Hungry as we are, we decide to eat at the restaurant at the ferry landing. Not
the worst choice! The freshly pressed orange juice is delicious and so are the
eggplant salad, grilled sea bass, and greek yoghurt with honey and raisins.

As we walk back to our apartment, we can watch a beautiful sunset behind
Telendos.
