The weather is finally getting nicer again and I used the chance to tick off
a bicycle ride from my bucket list: taking the train to Mittenwald and then
riding all the way back to Munich along the river Isar.

The train arrives at about 10am. That is a good time as the cold night (close
to freezing) starts turning into a lovely warm day. Just a couple hundred meters
from the train tracks, the Isar flows with its teal colored water in-between
the mountain landscape.

The first part of the route goes through the valley, but does not stay extremely
close to the Isar (even though it is the “Isarradweg”, the Isar bicycle trail).
But it doesn't impact the scenery at all.

The route turns East to follow the Isar through its narrow valley. It is a bit
disappointing that a major stretch of several kilometers is on a somewhat
larger road which is also used by many motorcyclists. They tend to not really
slow down when overtaking and do not respect the mandatory lateral distance of 2
meters.

Eventually I get to a beautiful lake formed by the Isar through a water
reservoir. The surface is smooth as glass today.

I now have completed 40km, which is about a third of today's distance. Time for
a lunch break!

After the lunch break, the route turns North heading pretty much directly
towards Munich. The mountains are turning into hills and soon into flats.
At the same time, the trees are getting much greener because I am now at less
altitude where it is a bit warmer (from Mittenwald to Munich I lose about 400m
of altitude).

I pass through the town of Bad Tölz before the route takes a detour from the
Isar which means I have to climb hills (some on bumpy gravel roads). Though,
it is worth it as I also get some pretty good downhill rides before coming
back to the Isar.

From one of the hills after Bad Tölz I get a nice view back to the mountains
which lie in the distance now.

Before reaching Grünwald close to Munich, I have to climb another long hill.
Here the Isar itself is much lower than the surroundings. In Grünwald,
I check out a rock climbing tower I learned about recently. Due to Corona
regulations it cannot be used at the moment, but maybe I get a chance in summer.

From there on, I know the remaining route well because I have taken it several
times to a Munich bouldering spot. It is also pretty straight-forward, just
following the Isar. The closer I get to the city center, the more people fill
the paths.

With breaks, the whole tour of 122km took me about 7:30h. Of that I spent about
5:30h in the saddle which makes an average speed of 22.4km/h. On one of the
downhill parts, I managed to reach a maximum speed of 50km/h.
