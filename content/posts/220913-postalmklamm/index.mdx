Today we plan to do the Postalmklamm via ferrata in the Postalm gorge. After
a short bus ride to Strobl, we take a cab to the parking lot at the approach
trail.

After a short 15 minute approach, the via ferrata directly starts with
a challenge: a swinging suspension bridge.

After a more “classical”, but often wet and slippery part, a special rope bridge
follows.

Then the third crossing of the Gorge follows. This time it isn't even a bridge,
but you have to make a large step across (or hang from the steel rope with your
hands).

A final, but easy, bridge follows. Then the via ferrata starts to climb out of
the gorge. At the end of this first part, we have a short break.

This first part took us about 90 minutes. Next we have to hike up a little bit.
In one spot, we lose the trail completely because it made nearly a 180 degree
turn that was not well marked. And because we weren't the first to accidentally
continue straight, there was already a well-trodden trail continuing straight.

Thirty minutes later and 100m higher, we make it to the next, harder part of the
via ferrata with multiple D spots. This is now much sunnier and actually dry
rock.

Another 30 minutes later and 60m higher, we are finished with the via ferrata.
Now, we hike back down to our starting point. From there we want to continue to
an inn for lunch. The map shows two paths, either the less nice and longer
variant along the road or the more direct narrow trail. However, we don't now
where that second trail is supposed to be exactly. I remember that I saw a sign
towards the via ferrata on the approach trail. It surprised me because in that
spot was seemingly no intersection of trails. We decide to descent the few
minutes to that spot again and indeed we find the inconspicuous trail, that we
are looking for, there. You sort of need to know that it is there to actually
see it. We hike through some lovely landscape from there.

After about 1:40h, we reach the inn. Apparently, the previous German chancellor
Helmut Kohl used to already eat here. We all decide for some variation of
knödel.

Having regained some energy, we hike another hour back to Strobl.

After about 1:10h, we are back in Strobl and take the bus back to Bad Ischl. We
ascended over 450m and descended 725m today.
