Today we wake up a little bit earlier, get a croissant, and eat it as we hike
up to Trois ﾃ四ots. We want to get an early start before it gets too warm and
sunny. Only Jonas will join a bit later. It is already pretty warm, hiking up in
the sun, but at least the wall is in the shade for now.

I take it easy today as I'm hoping to try my project tomorrow again and want to
be sufficiently rested. But also the less hard routes in this sector are quite
enjoyable. In particular, 1995 <Grade value="6b" system="french" /> is very
cool and unique.

As the wall gets sunny around noon, we descend and look for a place for lunch.
I have a delicious greek salad. We do not climb more in the afternoon, but do
the usual rest day activities: watching the 2nd half of the World Cup final,
refill water, get some ice cream, and have a swim in the sea.

For dinner we walked a bit farther than usual to Anna's tavern. We mostly picked
it because it had Anna's name. But it turned out to be a good choice. We got
fresh fish (we could pick the exact fish ourselves again), a soup as appetizer
and [loukoumades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lokma) (honey balls) for
dessert. Everything was quite tasty and the price very reasonable.
