Unfortunately, we have to depart today despite the amazing weather. We start the
hike down, but stop in Reithle for some sport climbing. I start with Esel streck
dich (“donkey, stretch yourself”) <Grade system="french" value="5c+" />. It seems
quite sandbagged to me and I don't climb in cleanly. The next route Teufelsriss
(“devil's crack”) <Grade system="french" value="5c+" /> is much nicer. We also use
it a bit to practice gear placement.

Then I try Herrenriss <Grade system="french" value="6a" /> which is a really nice
crack climb. It takes a bit figuring out and thus I need a second go for the
redpoint. Finally, Marco climbs Jägersteig <Grade system="french" value="6a+" />
without many problems. After Fabian struggled to start it, I try to and
struggle too. It takes me quite some time to get over the start. Afterwards it
gets a bit better, but it feels extremely sandbagged to me.

In the early afternoon we descend the last bit to our parked cars. On the way
we pass under
a [highline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacklining#Highlining),
but no one is on it.

Despite the rainy days it was a nice vacation.
