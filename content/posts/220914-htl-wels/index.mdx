There are dark clouds in the sky, but the forecast said it is going to stay dry.
Thus, we take the Feuerkogel cable car to do the HTL Wels via ferrata at the
Alberfeldkogel.

Unfortunately, it starts to rain, just as we arrive at the summit station. In
addition, it is extremely windy, though at least that was expected due to
forecast. It seems that we won't be able to do the via ferrata, but now that we
are up here, we want to at least hike up to the Alberfeldkogel on the easy
hiking trail. Though, my dad needs a bit convincing to step out of the summit
station into the rain.

Luckily, the rain stops soon after, as quickly as it started. A bit before the
summit the via ferrata approach trail branches off. We stand around for a while
and debate what to do, now that the rain stopped again and there is actually one
person visible in the ferrata. We are concerned about the approach as it was
described as extremely slippery by some. Moreover, it is still quite windy and
the via ferrata seems pretty exposed.

In the end, my parents decide not to do the via ferrata. However, I decide to do
it alone (and to turn around if the approach gets to dangerous). The wind is
a pretty warm and is not affecting me much, even at the exposed saddle where
we are standing currently. The via ferrata is also easy enough that I should be
able to climb it in wet conditions if it were to rain again (and the strong wind
at least helps to dry it quickly).

As I descend to the start of the via ferrata, it turns out that the approach
trail is not nearly as slippery as expected. It is steep, but mostly you climb
down rocks and not grassy slopes.

The via ferrata itself turns out to be pretty wind protected and is perfectly
dry.

On the summit, after barely more than 30 minutes of via ferrata and 160m of
elevation gain, it is much windier again. Thus, I only spend a short moment to
take in the view before walking back to the cable car with my parents and
descending back into the valley.

At least for me this last via ferrata was a nice completion of the vacation. The
remainder of the day we spend packing for our departure tomorrow.
