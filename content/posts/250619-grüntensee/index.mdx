Today will be another relaxed day. In the morning, I just cycle 20km to
Sonthofen, where I visit the Alpenstadtmuseum. The museum has an exhibition
about the history and life in Sonthofen, a small city located within the Allgäu
mountains. Currently, there is also a special exhibition about the mountain rescue that
I find quite interesting.

It is past noon once I'm finished with the museum. I get a piece of cake and
a lemonade in the café. An elderly married couple stops by and is debating
whether it is okay to already eat cake at this time, but seeing me they are
convinced that it is. Afterwards, I look for an ATM and get an ice cream on the
way. As I walk back to my bicycle, I happen to pass the couple again and
they comment, “an ice cream would be quite okay now too”. Not sure what I did
that they take me as some sort of role model. Anyway, time to continue to
cycling.

On the next stretch, I have quite some headwinds and some steep ascents. Another
crazy person with as much luggage as me and unmotorised bicycle (quite the
rarity these days) comes the other way. He is riding downhill with wind from the
back and I'm a bit envious. Nevertheless, I manage to overtake a couple on
lightly packed gravel bikes twice. They took the shorter road, whereas I took
the longer, but nicer, gravel detour.

Today, I am staying at a campsite at the Grüntensee. Of course, staying at a lake
means it goes quite a bit downhill, which is nice for current Jan, but
future Jan has to climb all of it back up tomorrow.

After pitching the tent, I light my stove to cook some pasta. Another,
middle-aged female cyclist with minimalist equipment turns up. She asks me to
lend her a USB cable so she can charge her phone (her cable broke), and we talk
a bit. She is also doing the same route as me, but did what I did in two days in
a single day and is planning to do more relaxed distances the next days. We both
plan to arrive by Monday.

I end the day with a swim in the lake and a shower. Today's total distance was
53.7km and took me 3 hours with an average speed of 17.9km/h. I reached
a maximum speed of 53.2km/h.
