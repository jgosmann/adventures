As Anna cannot do much with her foot in a cast, she is flying back to Munich
today, where her parents will pick her up. We bring her and Antoine to the train
station in Finale Ligure from where they travel to the Genoa airport.
The rest of us continues to Antro delle Streghe so that Marco has the chance to
experience some Ligurian rock before the weather turns worse (if the forecast is
to be believed).

Because my skin is still painful, I stick to easier routes. The only exception
in a route that overlaps with another route higher up, but is also close to yet
another route. As I get there, I'm a bit unsure on which bolt line it continues.
I eventually figure out that it should be the right line, but some Italians who
want to climb the overlapping line are unhappy with that and tell me it is the
left line. I give in to them, knowing that it cannot be harder than <Grade
system="french" value="6b" />. But after checking the guidebook on the ground,
it is clear that they were wrong. <Link to="/posts/210912-bw3-adamplatte/">Never
trust what other climbers are saying.</Link> Of course I cannot send the route
cleanly, even on my second try, due to my skin and some painful pockets.

The last route of the day is a nice crack, Chi vive vola <Grade system="french"
value="6a+" />, that I can flash. After there has occasionally be some drizzle,
it now starts to properly rain, as I get down. Covered under some rock we have
our lunch break. While the rain shower soon stops again, much of the rock is now
wet and we decide to call it a day. (Obviously my skin also needs some recovery.)

We drive back to Finalborgo, where we meet up with Antoine, who has returned
from the airport. We have some coffee/tea and cake before exploring the old city
core and the castle a bit up on a hill. Conveniently, the entrance at the casle
is free today.

When we return home, proper heavy rain starts. But for dinner we have to leave
once more. We try the last place we haven't been to in Calice. The food is
excellent and probably made from what is available in good quality and in season
at the time, as there is only a very general written menu and the owner explains
the detailed ingredients of each dish to us. I start with a series of five
antipasti and continue with a risotto.
