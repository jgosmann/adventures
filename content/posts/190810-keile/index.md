This weekend I am attending a course with the German Alpine club (DAV) about
placing trad gear such as nuts and cams. It is in southern part of the
Frankenjura, a well known climbing area within Germany about 90 minutes north of
Munich. It is famous for [Action
Directe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Directe_(climb)), the world's
first 5.14d (UIAA 11).

The Saturday morning is rainy, but after an introductory round with the five
other participants and guide, the rain
stops and we can start practicing placing the nuts ands cams. We also learn
about anchor building and some self-rescue things.

In the afternoon, we start placing the gear and testing it with falls using
a backup toprope line. All my nuts hold, but one of the friends that I believed
to be bomber failed. Upon closer inspection it seems that there was a thin layer
of a different (brittle) mineral on the rock that was broken away on the impact.

We have a nice dinner outside at the inn where we staying for the night. On
Sunday we place and test more gear. I have again a cam that fails on the second
fall (it held the first one). Not sure why. Maybe I place them in places that
are worse for gear in the first place because it does not fit a nut.

We also learn and practice a number of crack climbing techniques. It is the
first time I stack my hands in a crack. Actually on a pretty nice crack route
that starts out with a crack wide enough to stack your hands, than transitions
to a crack that you can fist jam until it gets thinner and thinner so that you
transition to hand jams and finally an easy finger lock.

All in all, a fun and informative course. I definitely feel a bit more confident
to lead (some easy) trad climbs. It was also great to test the placements and
see how much they hold (or do not hold).
