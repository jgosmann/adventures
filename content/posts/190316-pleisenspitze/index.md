The winter season is ending, we already had some quite warm days in Munich, and
even the first barbeque of the year happened at my work place. Reasons enough to
have a final, grandiose snow shoe weekend with Fabian, Martin, Kristina, and
Susanne with the goal to summit the Pleisenspitze at 2569 meters above sea
level.

Unlike the other hikes, this is a two day adventure and allows us to have a late
start on Saturday with a train leaving at 10:32. Originally, we planned to stay
on it until the little Austrian town of Scharnitz, but this requires to get
an additional ticket (because it is one stop outside of Germany) and the
conductor tells us that we could walk from Mittenwald (the last stop in Germany)
to Scharnitz. We are pretty sure that the conductor himself never did this, but
check out the option regardless and decide for it because we have quite some
time.

At about 12:40 we arrive in Mittenwald and immediatly feel out of place with our
snow shoes because it is quite warm. Time to apply some sunscreen.

To get to Scharnitz by foot, we follow more or less the river Isar which also
flows through Munich. Except for one 80 meter ascend and descend, it is a pretty
flat trail. On some stretches, however, is a thin layer of mushy and slippery
snow which is slightly annoying and not deep enough to put on the snow shoes.

Anyways, we make it to the German-Austrian border. Not that you would notice in
any way; it is Europe after all. But this ravine apparently marks the border.

Finally, after 850 meters of elevation gain, we reach the Pleisenhütte,
a smallish cabin where we will stay for the night with a bunch of other snow
shoe hikers and skiers. Such cabins are pretty typical in the Alps. The comfort
can vary quite a bit; in this case it is somewhat minimal as there is no running
water (there might be in the summer).  But we get a single room just for the
five of our group while some of the other groups have to share rooms. It is also
not uncommon to have communal bunks with twenty to thirty people in one big room
in such a hut.

We enjoy the last light of the day on the patio with some drinks. Which requires
us to put on surprisingly many layers to prevent us from getting cold, given
that we were hiking in T-Shirts.

Afterwards we move into the warm dining room of the cabin and order some warm
dinner. The menu offers a selection of local dishes, many of them involving some
kind of [Knödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del). Once satisfied we
pass the remaining evening with games under the light of oil lamps and head
lamps until we finally go to sleep.
