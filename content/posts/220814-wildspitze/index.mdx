Fabian is the first to get up around 4:30am. Everyone else stays in bed for 10
more minutes. I did not sleep well or a lot, but at least a bit. That is already
more than in the first night of my <Link
to="/posts/210819-alpine-tours-course">alpine tours course</Link>. The
acclimatization to the altitude affects the sleep. Besides sleeplessness, the
dreams tend to be a bit more bizarre and you might occasionally wake up gasping
a bit for air or hyperventilating. I also had to get up to pee in the middle of
the night. Apparently that is a good sign of the acclimatization progressing.

At 5am we get breakfast with lots of other guests. Everything is a bit hasty.
Luckily, my appetite isn't affected much by the height. About 30 minutes later
we prepare our packs, put on our shoes, and are off to summit the Wildspitze,
Tyrol's highest mountain with 3770m.

First we follow a rocky path. It is not super well marked and we lose it at
times. But it does not really matter as it is pretty much the same terrain
everywhere and the general direction as clear.

We will have to cross a ridge line through a saddle (the Mitterkarjoch). To get
there, we have to ascent the first glacier, or rather the sad remains of it.
While there is some ice left, it is covered in scree. We put on our crampons
anyways. They give us good traction on the few icy spots, but also allow
climbing on rocks, even though it requires a little bit getting used to.

We take a while to figure out the best place to get across the bergschrund (the
cleft between the glacier ice frozen to the rock face and the flowing part of
the glacier). In that time, another group catches up with us. For a while we are
climbing in parallel through the gully leading up to the saddle. After some more
loose gravel we finally hit (mostly) solid rock with a via ferrata getting us
over the steeper parts.

At the other side of the saddle, a “real” glacier finally awaits us. After
a short energy bar break, we get out our ice picks (or hiking sticks depending
on preference), get across another bergschrund, and orient ourselves towards the
Wildspitze.

The first part of the glacier is quite flat and thus we do not encounter any
crevasses there. But then we have to cross a steeper part with quite a few
crevasses wide enough to easily fit a person. We can walk around most of them or
find stable ice bridges, but for one we have to actually climb down a bit and
back out (about a person's height).

After crossing the glacier, we have to gain another 150m to 200m elevation by
climbing a ridge line (not more than <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />). Around
four hours after leaving the hut and a total ascent of about 900m, we reach the
summit of the Wildspitze. The highest mountain that I stood on so far.

After a lunch (second breakfast?) break, we start our descent on the same route.

During the descent I get a very light headache. Another effect of the altitude
and a sign that I am not fully acclimatized to the current height yet. But
nothing to be concerned about as we are already descending and, indeed, the
headache will be gone by the time we reach the hut again.

Back to the Mittelkarjoch, we have to down climb the via ferrata and then
descent back down on the scree. Once we're out of immediate rock fall danger, we
have another short break. Excluding that break we make it back to the Breslauer
hut after about another 3 hours.

At the hut, we get some food
([Germknödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germkn%C3%B6del) and [apple
strudle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strudel)) and drinks. We need to refill
our energy reserves as the day is not over yet. We have to pick up some gear we
left at the hut and then hike another two hours to the Vernagthütte. We will
stay the next two nights there.

Luckily, all of the path is pretty much on the same elevation so that we do not
have to go up and down a lot. Only at the end we have to descent to a bridge
across a stream and ascent another 150m.

The Vernagthütte is a bit more cozy than the Breslauer Hütte. The latter one is
reachable with a cable car and a short hike, but to get to the Vernagthütte one
has to be a little bit more committed, which filters out some of the more
touristy people.

After dinner (soup, [Goulash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash#Germany) and
rice, ice cream), we discuss the plans for the next day. There might be
thunderstorms in the afternoon. Thus, whatever we do, we need to be back early
enough. There might also a bit of rain in the morning. In the end, we decide to
risk it and are the only group staying at the hut that orders breakfast for 5am
again. Our plan is to climb the Fluchtkogel (3494m) in a round-trip fashion.
But first we get to bed early (it is not even 9pm) to get some sleep and
regeneration after a long nine hour tour (excluding breaks).
