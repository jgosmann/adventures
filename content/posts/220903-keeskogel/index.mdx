We wake up at 5:30am and have actually slept well, now that the humming noise is
fixed and we were the only ones in the room (even though Christian did snore
a little bit). We planned for a 3.5h ascent to the Keeskogel (3291m) because
this was the time posted on the signpost near the hut. However, at breakfast one
person from the hut personal tells us that it is only a two hour ascent and that
he has no idea who came up with the time on the signpost. Thus, we have much
larger time buffer than we thought and can have a relaxed breakfast.

After breakfast, we start our ascent. As we get higher, the trails becomes more
rocky and eventually we start climbing across somewhat big blocks which is quite
fun.

Ascending the 700m of elevation to the summit took us indeed only about two
hours. It is much warmer (and less windy) than on the Großvenediger summit.
We can really enjoy the view and chat with another group that reaches the summit
shortly after us.

Then it is time to descent again, enjoying some last views of the Großvenediger
and our ascension route.

Back at the hut, after about 1:40h, we have some more time to relax. We have
lunch while enjoying the sun on the patio (I have another Kaspressknödel soup,
the others spinach knödel, Beatrice and I eat the last pieces of the
[mirabelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabelle_plum) cake).

Then we descent about 600m, taking us a little bit over an hour, to where the
shuttle picks us up to bring us back to our car.
