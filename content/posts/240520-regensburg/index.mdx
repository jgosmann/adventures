I wake up early at 6:30am. Nevertheless, I leave the campsite a bit later than
I would have liked at 8:30am because I take a while to find the pack sack of
my tent that was hiding beneath my panniers. With some tailwinds, the ride to
Regensburg along the Danube is fast. It turns out to be also a bit shorter than
expected with 32.7km, and so I reach the Regensburg central station already
shortly past 10am. It took me only 90 minutes with an average speed of 21.9km/h
and a maximum speed of 37km/h.

At the central station, I lock up my bike in a bicycle box that I reserved and
cost me only 1€. Then I start to explore Regensburg itself.

The first highlight is the Scots Monastery St Jakob. It is one of the main
pieces of Romanic architecture, but seldom visited by large tourist groups.
Thus, the inside is quite tranquil. The sun, shining in through the high windows
and leaving their traces in the incense-loaded air, is very atmospheric.

I continue through the city core. Many building have towers attached, that the
rich trading families like the patricians built to demonstrate their power.

I am now at the Steinerne Brücke (“stone bridge“), the landmark bridge of
Regensburg. It was quite the engineering feat when it was built. In the attached
former salt storage building is a free exhibition regarding Regensburg UNESCO
world heritage status, that I walk through, before I do the obligatory crossing
of the bridge forth and back. I also visit the Brückturmmuseum (“bridge tower
museum”), mainly for the view recommended by my guidebook, but it doesn't turn
out to be that great. Luckily, the entrance fee was cheap.

As it is around lunch time, and I am at the historic Wustlhaus (“sausage
house”), I get one of their traditional Regensburg sausages in a bun with
sauerkraut and sweet mustard. It's tasty!

With new energy, I visit the cathedral, another highlight. Entering the large, but
dark interior is also quite the experience as the eyes slowly adjust to the
darkness and start to make out increasingly more details. This is still similar
to the experience you would have had in medieval times.

My next stop is the Porta Praetoria, the remains of a city gate that was built
by the Romans!

I also visit a steamboat with a museum regarding boating on the Danube as well as
some sights of the inner workings of a steamboat. From here, I continue to the
house where Johannes Kepler lived for a couple of years and died in.
Unfortunately, it is closed today and I cannot visit the interior.

There is really a lot of churches in Regensburg, and the Alte Kapelle (“old
chapell“), decorated in rococo style is the next I visit. It is apparently
a quite important representative of the style, but for my liking its too
overloaded.

Finally, I pay a visit to the basilica St Emmeram, decorated in the style of
baroque, which is still too overloaded for my taste.

To finish of my tour of Regensburg, I climb the tower of the
Dreieinigkeitskirche (“trinity church“). Here I get a really good view of
Regensburg and the surrounding landscape.

I have an early dinner in a small place where I order a [poke
bowl](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poke_(dish)>) and an Aperol
[Spritz](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spritz_(cocktail)>). The bowl is really good,
especially the salmon. Maybe I should have gotten the large instead of regular
bowl. As desert I get an ice cream on my walk back to the central station. Some
reviews of the ice cream place said stuff like it was the best ice cream they
had in 30 years. However, while it was decent, the ice cream place near me in
Munich has definitely better ice cream.

At the train station I still have to get a ticket for the return journey to
Munich. But several ticket machines are out of order. When I finally find
a working one, it is not one of the models I'm used to, quite slow and then,
after going through all the menus, it won't let me pay by card. I then order the
ticket via my smartphone, but it turns out I cannot get a ticket for my bicycle
that way. So I have to get back to another ticket machine. There I can finally
get a ticket for my bicycle, though, I am unsure whether it is actually valid
today (I think it was not after double checking later), but it is the only
option I'm presented with. After all this hassle I still manage to board the
train one minute past its departure time. Luckily, the German trains are that
punctual. My (probably not valid) bicycle ticket is also accepted.

This ends a short, but rather nice vacation, where I saw a lot of my Bavarian
surroundings.
