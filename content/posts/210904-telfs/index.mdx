For our last day in Telfs, we saved up one of Austria's hardest via ferratas: the
Kaiser Max via ferrata (emporer Max via ferrata). Situated in the Martinswand
(<Link to="/posts/200712-flying-grass/">where I climbed before</Link>), it
features about 300m of climbing, split into two sections. The first section is
rated D, while the second section has a proper E rating.

The climbing in the first section is steep at times, but with a decent amount of
good rest spots.

My parents exit after the first section to a grotto.

I continue, however, into section 2. It first traverses right on a bit easier
terrain (C), before going up through a D/E stretch that leads to a fairly good
rest spot.

After the rest spot, a long, slightly overhanging stretch of difficulty
E follows. Efficient climbing is key here. At one point my carabiner gets stuck
on a hook holding the steel cable in place. This is annoying because I have to
move back down a bit to unhook it. But all in all I make it through the part
without much trouble.

After this first E part a short easy stretch, another shorter E part follows.
While the first E part felt definitely a bit harder to me than all the D/E via
ferratas, the second E part feels not as hart as the first one to me. It is also
not really overhanging anymore.

Afterwards, the first part of the descent is still a via ferrata, but very easy
(max. B). My parents come a bit the other way to meet me before we descent the
main trail together.

Overall, the via ferrata took us (me) 3:15h with 0:20h for the approach, 0:50h
for section 1, 1:20h for section 2 (including descent via ferrata), and 0:40 for
the descent. I ascended a total of 440m. Section 1 had an ascent of 150m,
section 2 of 210m

The rest of the day, we spent packing because sadly we have to leave the next
day. On the train ride back to Munich, we get another good view of the
Martinswand with the grotto and via ferrata.
