My employer invited its employees once more to a summer retreat in the
Interalpen-Tyrol hotel. Together with a few colleagues, I organized a rock
climbing outing to the Flämenwandl. The crag turns out to be quite ideal for the
occasion with a variety of routes at different levels. It is also in the shade
until the afternoon which is welcome on a hot day like today.

We setup some top ropes on the easier and intermediate routes for the beginners.
This way I warm up on two <Grade system="french" value="5c" /> routes. Later
I also get the chance to climb the two hardest routes at the crag:
Donnerrose <Grade system="french" value="6b+" /> (“thunder rose”) and Jean Marie
Pfaff <Grade system="french" value="6b+" />. The former I manage to flash, the
later I redpoint on my second attempt. It has quite the roof that I need to
figure out the beta for. But apart from the short cruxes, the routes are not
that hard and in general I feel like the crag has soft grading.

Back in the hotel and after some coffee and snacks, we have time to relax a bit.
After a shower I have a nap. Our bus left at 7am and thus I am quite tired by
now.

This time I got a room on the 6th floor (European counting, 7th storey if you
count American) just below the highest floor with the suites. It had a quite
nice view.

In the evening, we could enjoy a delicious four course menu consisting of marbled
vegetables with salsa verde and buffalo mozzarella; cream soup of herbs with
tomato crips bread; medium-roasted fillet of veal with lemon sauce, roasted
vegetable cream, Romanesco and red win shallot tart; and finally a dessert
buffet. The portions where quite small, but luckily we could get seconds.
