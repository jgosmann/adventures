Because of the planned tour, we wake up early at 5:45am again. I am having some
trouble with nose bleeding. It first happened when going to bed yesterday
evening, once in the middle of the night and now again after getting up.
I suppose the dry air at altitude is affecting it.

We planned to start our tour to the Hohe Riffl (3338m) at 7am, but our
instructor requests to wait an additional 15 minutes, so it will already be
a little bit warmer. The weather is forecasted to be great all day, thus we have
no tight time constraints.

On the way we have to find our route between some crevasse areas, but it is not
too difficult.

It is important to drink enough at high altitude. Of course, some of the liquid
has to leave the body again. During a short break one of women announces that she
has to pee and it turns out that actually all of us have to pee. But on the
glacier it is not safe to unclip from the rope and there is nothing to hide
behind anyways. Thus, the pragmatic solution: all the women turn into one
direction, all the men into the other, and then we relief ourselves at the same
time with roughly 8 meter gaps.

To reach the summit, we have to cross a ridge out of snow and then climb the
last bit on somewhat loose rock. Exciting!

Then we made it. We enjoy the view and have a second breakfast or early lunch break.

Then it is time to head back down.

Almost at the end of the glacier, pretty close back to the hut, we finally find
some snow-free ice. There, Steven shows us how to setup and use a fixed rope in
steep, icy terrain. We can also practice walking on ice with our crampons.

We celebrate our summit at the hut with
[Kaiserschmarren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiserschmarrn) as a late lunch.
The tour took us about 6:30h with about 490m ascent and descent. After we have
eaten, we spend some more time recapping some of the things we have learned over
the last days behind the hut.
