It is another rainy day and we decided to visit Bern. First, we visit the
Einstein house, where Albert Einstein lived for several years. The rooms
themselves aren't that interesting, but it has a little exhibition about his life.

Then we move on to the historic museum that also hosts a larger exhibition about
Einstein. It also focusses on his life, though it also provides some basic
explanations of the theory of relativity. I quite like how the episodes of his
life are put into context of general historic events during those times.

Finally, we get a bite to eat, stroll a bit through the city, looking at the
famous Zytglogge clock and the Bern Minster, before heading back to Grindelwald.
