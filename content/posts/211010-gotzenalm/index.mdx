For the second day of our short weekend vacation, we wanted to the Grünstein via
ferrata. We wake up at 6am again and drive to the Königssee. There we find out,
unfortunately, that the via ferrata is closed due to damage caused by severe
weather. Thus, we search for a hike online that is a suitable alternative. We
pick a supposedly difficult hike to the Gotzenalm and a nearby viewing point
above the Königssee.

We first hike up to the Königsbachalm. The hike follows pretty much a gravel
road, not really difficult yet, but with a few nice views of the lake between the
trees.

After the Königsbachalm, the trail gets a little bit more difficult for a while,
but then we are back a gravel road.

Eventually, we get to the plateau with the Gotzenalm. First, we take a little
detour to the aforementioned viewing point and enjoy the view of the Königssee
and Watzmann (for the short moments it peaks through the clouds). This Eastern
face of the Watzmann is the tallest in the Eastern Alps and a famous climbing
route ascends it. It isn't even that hard (<Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />),
however, you have to do much of it free solo and the navigation is supposed to
be really difficult. Even worse, getting off route in that rock face can be
really dangerous!

Then we walk the last bit to the Gotzenalm where we have hot chocolate and
coffee.

For the descent from the Gotzenalm to the Königsbachalm, we choose a different
route. It turns out to be actually quite nice and the trail can be considered to
be of medium difficulty (but certainly not difficult).

From the Königsbachalm we take the same route back that we came up.

In total we were hiking 6:40h with a difference of about 1350m in elevation. Our
peak elevation was about 1740m, though we did not have a real summit.
