Today we want to do the Mürren-Gimmelwald via ferrata. To get there, we have to
take two different trains, a gondola, and another train. The changeovers are
always just a few minutes, but it works perfectly because the Swiss trains are
almost always on time. This would never have worked in Germany.

The approach to the via ferrata is very short and doesn't involve any ascent
because Mürren is on top of the cliff (where we got with the gondola). At the
start of the via ferrata, we meet a Swiss (?) couple again that was already
yesterday in front of us on the via ferrata. The guy appears not quite as secure
on the via ferrata as the girl.

After going through the first bit quickly, we end up in a long queue and for the
remainder of the via ferrata we move rather slowly. The via ferrata is quite
overrun and many people absolutely must take pictures for social media.
Secretly I'm hoping that one guy drops his selfie stick to enjoy some
schadenfreude, but it doesn't happen. Admittedly, the scenery is great and there
is a stretch where it is quite exposed with a lot of air beneath you.
Apparently, base jumpers also like the cliff. At one point I can even spot
a wing suit flyer shooting through the valley and deploying their parachute.

When we are finally finished with the via ferrata, we have a poke bowl and some
cider before going back to Grindelwald with a gondola, bus, and two trains. It
works again flawlessly.
