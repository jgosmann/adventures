Today we're climbing in the sector Le Tecchie. Antoine is also back with us as
Anna got her crutches and can manage to survive alone at our vacation home.

<Loc latlong={[44.19922, 8.314741]} zoom={13} />

After some warm ups, I try La porta della percezione <Grade system="french"
value="6b+" />. It requires quite some cursing as the upper part of the line
turns out to be quite unclear. After trying a lot of things, I figure out that
one has to go quite far left from the line to get onto a slab where you then
have to traverse all the way back to the right. There, the chains are to be
found hidden in some vegetation. But I can send the route on my the second try
and it does have some nice moves.

The routes Mel <Grade system="french" value="6a" /> and Fischia il vento <Grade
system="french" value="6b+" /> are also quite enjoyable. The former features
a corner, the later has a nice sequence on crimps and pockets.

After climbing, we have an obligatory ice cream at our gelato place, and then
pizza dinner on the patio of the Piccolo bar. Unfortunately, there smokers
are around.
