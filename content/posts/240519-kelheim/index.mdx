After a rich breakfast, I start shortly before 9am. I still follow the Isar for
a short stretch, but soon turn north and ride through a landscape with more
hills. This means some more climbs, but also nice downhill rides. I also have
some, but not too strong, headwinds.

After a while, I fall off the map. I forgot to check to what extent I have
installed maps on my GPS unit before embarking on the trip. Map for everything
around Munich and a considerable part of the Alps are installed because that's
where I am going most of the time. But usually I don't get this far north. At
least, I still have the GPS track of Martin and Kristina, who did the same tour
a few years back, that I follow. This still works pretty well without a map.
Only at a few neuralgic points I have to pull out my phone to check Google Maps.

A bit past 11am and 44km in, I find a nice bench for my lunch break at
a crossroads. After a while two horse-riding children with accompanying adults
come by. They comment that it's the first time they see someone using the bench
and usually their pony is afraid of this spot when no-one is sitting here.

A while later, I pass through Abensberg. It has a pretty old city core. But the
actual tourist attraction is a local brewery that built a tower, designed by the
famous Hundertwasser, into its beer garden.

Eventually, I reach the Danube after 80km. There is a small beer garden in this
spot where I have another break with
[Leberkas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leberk%C3%A4se), potato salad, and
a [Radler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandy#Radler) (beer with lemonade, the
name is German for “cyclist”); in short, typical Bavarian beer garden cuisine.

Afterwards, I follow a trail along the Danube with nice views, but it is quite
narrow and has quite muddy patches every few meters. Riding a bicycle isn't
really that much fun here and it doesn't take long for my bike to be completely
dirty. The mud even builds up under the fenders, such that the tires rub against
it. After I make it through, I find some signage explaining that this part of
the Danube cycling path is in very bad condition and that you are supposed to
take a different route around. Well, unfortunately too late for me now. From
here the paths get better again, though there are still some muddy spots, so my
bicycle would have gotten dirty either way.

Soon, I reach the Weltenburg monestary located at the Weltenburger Enge (Danube
gorge near Weltenburg). Seeing this narrow section of the river flowing through
the high cliffs is a highlight of the tour, but also a major tourist attraction
making it quite busy.

To continue, I have to take a small ferry, secured with a cable from drifting
away, to the other river side. Here, it is much less busy. A steep climb to get
on top of the cliffs follows. East of the gorge I roll down again to get another
view from the other side. However, I have fight all of this back up to the next
stop at the Befreiungshalle (“Hall of Liberation”). It is monument commissioned
by the Bavarian king Ludwig to commemorate the victory over Napoleon. The inside
is indeed quite impressive and from the gallery you get a good view of the
surrounding landscape. Incidentally, there is a small thunderstorm that quickly
passes while I'm inside. Perfect timing! Afterwards, the weather is quite sunny
again.

From the Befreiungshalle, I go down to Kelheim, do a short round through the old
city core and then continue a little bit more along the Danube to a campsite on
a farm. After a short shower, I visit a beer garden just a few minutes away by
foot for dinner. I decide for [ćevapčići](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%86evapi),
not quite classical Bavarian cuisine, but at least some variation given that
I already visited a beer garden today.

I covered a distance of 106km cycling today. Given the hilly landscape
in-between the two rivers, my average speed was a bit lower today with 18km/h or
6h of cycling. I reached a maximum speed of 56km/h on one of the downhill rides.
