The weather forecast for today isn't great. Thus, we limit ourselves to
activities that can also be done with a bit of rain. First, we visit the glacier
gorge of Grindelwald. It is not that different from other gorges that you can
find in the alps. In one spot they build a large net between the cliffs that you
can walk on, which is a bit fun.

Afterwards, we stroll a bit through the Grindelwald village that we haven't
explored much so far. Eventually, we had back to our vacation home with some
cake, before visiting the local museum. The visit is well timed as it rains
while we are inside the museum, but has stopped once we get out.

Unfortunately, we have to stop to buy some more groceries and after we leave the
supermarket it is pouring.
