In the night, it rained a little bit and we start a bit later for things to
dry off. We go to Arginonta Valley today. It stays cloudy until the afternoon
with a few more drops of rain in-between, but not enough to get anything wet.

After the first warmups, I want to see how much I can push the grades given that
I sent <Grade value="7a" system="french" /> in two tries two days ago. I chose
Smiths <Grade value="7b" system="french" /> as a test piece. According to the
guide book, it has an initial boulder problem and is then very easy. That should
make it quite suitable as a first of the grade.

The climb is in a cave that must be reached by a small via ferrata. I don't
bring the guide book up, in case the others staying at the main wall need it. The
climb turns out to be not easy (well, that was sort of the point of it). But
I figure out the moves incrementally. Somehow the supposedly very easy part is
definitely easier than the beginning but not quite as easy as hoped. And then
right at the end is a physical long reach. But somehow there is no extension to
the route (as there should be according to the guide book). Now it dawns on me:
I'm in the wrong route.

After coming down, I realize that I worked my way up Massive Attack <Grade
value="7c" system="french" />! Now that I did all the moves, it might become
a project? But first I get back to the route I actually wanted to climb. Also
there it takes me a few tries to figure the initial boulder, but then I send it
and the remainder turns out to be quite easy indeed. My first <Grade value="7b"
system="french" />!

To bring the day to a close, I climb Zephyros. The initial <Grade value="6a"
system="french" /> part does not cause any trouble. However, I do not have the
energy left to do the <Grade value="6c+" system="french" /> extension without
hang dogging.

For dinner we have grilled fresh fish at the Aegan Tavern. They allow you to
chose the specific fish you want yourself.
