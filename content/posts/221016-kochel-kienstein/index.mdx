It is hard to believe, but mid October we get another warm, summer-like weekend
day. No question that this has to be taken advantage of. So Fabian and I made
plans to go sport climbing near Kochel, at a crag called Kienstein.

<Loc latlong={[47.64434, 11.37275]} />

We decided for the earlier train at about 7:30am. Unfortunately, it is delayed
by about 20 minutes and we only have about 15 minutes to change in Tutzing. But
once the train arrives and we are in it, they tell us over the speakers that one
carriage will actually go directly to Kochel. Thus, we only have to change to
the correct carriage in Tutzing. In Kochel, we can also catch the connecting bus
without any stress or too much waiting. Thus, overall the commute worked out
quite well despite or even because of the delay.

Shortly before the bus departs, a young Asian woman surprisingly leaves the bus.
As the driver sets the bus in motion, a friend of hers runs to the front and
asks the him to wait until she gets back from the restroom. She got lucky that
the bus driver was friendly enough to wait a few minutes.

After the short bus ride, we need a moment to find the correct approach trail.
It is quite helpful that the guidebook clearly states that the path with the
barrier is the wrong one as that is the first trail we find.

At the crag, we take a while to orient ourselves. We then decide to climb “Sunset
Boulevard” first. A two-pitch climb with the grades <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6" /> and <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />. I lead the first pitch and
I am not disappointed. It features quite interesting, varied moves along a giant
flake creating an off-width crack. Parts of it I climb laybacking, but at one
point I even do an off-width jam with my shoulder and arm. A first for me! The
jam feels quite solid. Even a bit too solid because it isn't super easy to
loosen it and move further up. Unfortunately, I did not climb the pitch clean.
Figuring out the moves (and having the commitment to do them) took a few tries.
But that is a good excuse to come back and climb this wonderful pitch again.

Fabian follows me up, leads the second pitch, and gets lowered back to the
midway anchor by me. He found the second pitch to be much easier despite the
harder grade. I then also lead it and have to agree. I manage to flash it. Again
it has nice moves with some jugs, laybacks, and some corner climbing. Besides
the climbing, the view of the hills in warm fall colors is purely incredible.
I could imagine that this climb is also quite the experience during sunset as
the name suggest.

Afterwards, we do one more nice, easy climb. Unfortunately, Fabian got some
piece of food stuck in the wrong place during our lunch break and is having
repeated, heavy cough attacks. We don't want to risk this happening during him
belaying and thus decide to call it a day. Nevertheless, the route and weather
made the trip well worth it.

We have quite some time until the next train back to Munich and thus walk back
to the train station on a nice trail through the woods.
