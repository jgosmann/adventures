The alarm rings at 4am. At 4:30am we have breakfast. Everyone is still
half-asleep and few words are spoken. At 5am we leave the with the first light
to start our ascent to the Venediger Scharte. We are joined by Hans, the oldest
of all of us, who is travelling alone and was looking for rope party to join.
We get a beautiful sunrise and the moon is standing exactly above the mountain
peak Schwarze Wand (“black wall”).

As we get to the start of the glacier, Michael decides to turn around. He hasn't
been feeling well (already yesterday) with symptoms of a cold. It's a pity, but
might be the wiser choice given the exertion at high altitude that awaits us. He
will descend back to the Tauernhaus and travel back home. We speak goodbyes and
wish him to get well soon before continuing our ascent.

As we approach the Venediger Scharte, we leave Hans behind who will look for
another rope party to take him along the usual way up to the summit and then
down to the Kürsinger Hütte. The rest of us, however, does not ascend via the
usual way, but descends a bit to the North of the Venediger Scharte. <Link
to="/posts/220902-grossvenediger/">Last year in September</Link>, there was
a giant crevasse here, but at the moment it is not noticeable and completely
covered in snow. We then traverse over to the Meynow-Scharte, where we put on
crampons and start climbing the North ridge line in two rope parties.

As we start climbing, the weather gets foggy. This was to be expected, but as we
get hit by some snow and soft hail, our mountain guide starts to get nervous.
Getting into a thunderstorm on the ridge line would be real bad! He even
considers to retreat, but it isn't a great option either. When he re-checks the
weather forecast once more on his phone, it was updated and forecasts potential
thunderstorms two hours later than before. A slightly larger time window is good
news and we continue.

The crux of the ridge line is graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />, but
climbing it with crampons and gloves in foggy conditions gives it a different
adventurous feel. It is steeper than I imagined.

Then it gets easier again and soon we reach the summit of the Großvenediger
(3657m). Compared to September last year, there is a much more snow on top, so
that the summit is a few meters higher.

From the summit we descend to the Kürsinger Hütte, where I also stayed last
year. During the descent, the weather gets a little bit better, but stays cloudy.
While we had to navigate a labyrinth of crevasses last year in September, they
are now all covered with snow and we can walk pretty much in a direct line
across the glacier, which makes the descent quite a bit shorter and faster.

In the hut, we order some refreshments and food. Then we check-in and have a nap
before dinner in the evening. We are served
[Kassler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassler) with Sauerkraut and mashed
potatoes. The hut is quite full because they have a large group of aspiring
mountain guides staying there for some examination.
