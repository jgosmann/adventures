Pretty untypical for an alpine tour, we don't wake up early and have a relaxed
breakfast. It has been raining a lot during the night and is still raining in
the morning. We wait until shortly before 10am before we leave the cabin with
the rain finally getting less. We want to ascent the Schwarzenstein (3369m)
today.

As we follow the hiking trails, we have to cross multiple streams that have
gotten quite large with the nightly rainfall.

Eventually, the landscape becomes rockier and we end up in clouds and fog. For
the most part, the trail is still marked quite well and easy to follow. But in
a few spots we cannot see the next marking and have to rely on GPS. As we gain
elevation, we encounter a thin layer of snow on the rocks that gets thicker as
we get higher.

After a while we reach the glacier, where we rope up and put on our crampons.
The clouds recede a bit, and we get a view of the summit (or at least the
smaller summit in front of the main summit).

As we get onto the ridge line and follow it towards the summit, it gets quite
windy. Nevertheless, we push through to the summit.

Due to the conditions, we only stay a couple of minutes at the summit before
starting our descent. Now the clouds are engulfing us again. A bit of soft hail
is added to the strong winds, and conditions get truly uncomfortable. While I'm
not cold as long as we are moving, the margin for error has gotten narrow. If
anything would stop us in our tracks, we would get freezing cold quite quickly.

My glasses freeze over, and in the fog with snow all around us, we are in
a whiteout. There are no contours visible anymore and the world has shrunk to
a few meters around us. I blindly follow the rope and tracks in front of me,
while Fabian in front is following the track from our ascent back down.

A few hundred meters of elevation lower, the wind gets less (as we expected) and
conditions are much more comfortable. Off the glacier, we have a short break,
stow away our equipment, and continue with the descent. Soon there is no more
snow as most of it melted while we were on the glacier. Now some of the clouds
also part and we get another view of the summit. While earlier in the day we
heard a some bigger rock fall, we can also witness some rock fall with our own
eyes and capture some of it on camera. A reminder that the ice, keeping the
mountains together, is melting due to global warming.

After about eight hours and an elevation difference of about 1570m up and down,
we make it back to the cabin, on time for dinner. Today we have spinach lasagne.
We are joined by a Canadian couple from British Columbia at our table, which
makes for some interesting conversation given that I lived in Canada for quite
some time myself.
