The last weeks have already been quite warm for winter. It feels like spring is
already here and this weekend it is even warmer with temperatures up to 17°C.
My climbing buddies, Anja, Jonas, Anna, Antoine, and I decided to use the chance
for some outdoor sport climbing.

Anna, Antoine, and I took the train to lake Bernau at the lake Chiemsee from
where we were picked up by Anja and Jonas with the car for the last leg to the
crag.

We did some easy warmups before moving on to somewhat harder stuff. I got
shutdown on Hilti Hilti <Grade system="french" value="6a+" /> and had to hangdog
my way up. Antoine had less trouble, but the route just didn't click for me.

I was more successful on Workaholic <Grade system="french" value="6a+" />, one of
the classics of the crag, that I sent on my second try. It seemed quite hard on
the first try, but once you found all the holds and moves, it turned out to be
a lot easier.

At the end of the day, I was asked to climb Zeit für Gemütlichkeit (“time for
coziness”) <Grade system="french" value="6a+" />, another classic of the crag,
because the rest of the group couldn't finish it and we wanted the gear back.
I already had some trouble at the first overhang, but again mostly because the
holds weren't obvious. However, from the second to last draw to the last hanging
draw it suddenly got quite hard. I couldn't even get to the draw, which Jonas
managed to hang before, and supposedly it was even harder after that if he wasn't
able to finish the route. Eventually, my toes got too painful (I was breaking
in new climbing shoes) and a had myself lowered down. The Jonas took another
look at the guide book and figured out that the route branches and he took the
variant Ende der Gemütlichkeit (“end of the coziness”) <Grade system="french"
value="7a" />. Great! No wonder that no one managed to get up.

I then gave the actual Zeit für Gemütlichkeit another try and managed to send
it. On the way down I could clean the one draw hanging in Ende der Gemütlichkeit
as it was close enough to reach with a little swing.

We finished off a great day of climbing by eating dinner in a Thai restaurant in
Rosenheim on the way back to Munich.
