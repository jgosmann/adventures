Vera and Christine went to Squamish Valley yesterday and found the climbing to
be so good that we are going there again today. It is not an easy place to get
to. The all-wheel drive of our rental car is put to the test, there are spots
where Christine has to navigate in-between rocks and fallen trees slightly too
large to just drive over, and there is one hill that we make it up only with
enough momentum. Because the place is so hard to get to, we are the only ones
on the wall the whole day.

While I noticed that there is a lot of thimble berries around Squamish (which
I now know since the Sawtooth Mountain hike), I was not able to find any ripe
ones. But here are thimble berries all the way on both road sides and quite
a few tasty ripe ones.

We warm up on the fun routes Domestic Disturbance (5.10a) and Flypaper (5.10c).
Then we try the really great (top 100) Under the Influence (5.11a). I almost
get the onsight, but pump out a little bit too quickly just before the end and
need a second try for the clean ascent. Definitely a route that makes you
think a little bit. Our final route for the day is Upchuck (5.11b) which is
also a great, fun route including some crack jamming. I even do a proper
fist jam (probably the first time that I use one). At first I was not sure
whether to trust it, but it actually held bomber. It is a really nice success
for me to flash this route (I think my hardest flash so far) and shows that
I regained some mental strength over the last days.

For tomorrow Vera and I plan to attempt the 15 pitch climb Stairway to Heaven
all the way up the Chief. For such a long climb we need to be as efficient as
possible. It is often hard to locate the start of climbs with the guide book
descriptions. In order to not waste time on that tomorrow, we already head there
this late afternoon and look for the start. Indeed, it turns out that we are
lost for while. As we wander around, we meet our campsite neighbours who happen
to look for another climb close to the start of Stairway to Heaven. Together we
locate the right approach path.

In the evening, Vera and Christine drive to the Vancouver airport to pick up Tim
who will be joining us for the last few days. I already go to sleep to get
enough of it because we will be waking up before sunrise tomorrow and I will
have to lead the majority of pitches (including the hard ones).
