This Friday is a holiday in Germany and the weather is going to be quite nice
for once between all the gray, wet, and cold fall weather. Also, tomorrow is
supposed to be at least warm even though not as sunny. So we (Anna, Antoine,
Anja; Jonas is out due to sickness) decided to have a short two-day climbing
vacation at Karres near Imst.

<Loc latlong={[47.221805, 10.784497]} />

We climb all day in a sector where almost all the route names are based on
German fairy tales. I stick to easier stuff as I'm mentally not fully there due
to unrelated life events.

The night we stay at a hotel in Imst and have dinner at a Tyrolean restaurant.
