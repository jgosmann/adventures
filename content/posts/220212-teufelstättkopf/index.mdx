Another Saturday with incredible weather and low avalanche risk. Fabian and I
decided to summit the Teufelstättkopf (1758m).

We start our ascent from the East in Oberammergau.

It is a less strenuous ascent than last week and around lunch time we can
enjoy an amazing view from the narrow summit.

For our lunch break, we leave the windy summit and sit down on some rocks in the
warm sun and wind shadow.

We then decide to descent via the ridge line which gives us some more great
views.

In the lower forest part, we take advantage of the freedom offered by our snow
shoes for a while by searching our own trail through an untouched snow cover
(eventually following some actual hiking trail, though it was hard to see under
more than a meter of snow). Great fun!

Overall we hiked 15km and ascended 1000m.
