Today, Fabian and I do a fall hike. We start at 7:45 from Fischbachau and soon
ascend a quite narrow trail in the fog beneath fall-colored trees. It isn't an
officially marked hiking trail and we are the only ones on it. Eventually, we
make it onto the ridge line and follow it South.

We pass over the Heißenplatte (1593m) before our trail is joined by an official
trail for the last bit of the ridge line up to the Aiplspitz (1759m). This
part involves some easy climbing (<Grade system="UIAA" value="1" />) and we
start meeting some fellow hikers.

On the Aiplspitz we have a short break, enjoy the view, and descend on the other
side to the Spitzingsattel (1129m).

But our tour does not end at the Spitzingsattel. We climb another mountain, the
Brecherspitz (1683m). <Link to="/posts/201025-brecherspitz/">I have been on it
before.</Link> But this time we choose a different, again unmarked, narrow trail
along the East ridge.

The summit is quite busy. We have a little longer break, but eventually the cold
wind urges us to continue. Most of the time we are engulfed in a cloud, but
occasionally it clears up.

We then descent along the West ridge line and turn North towards Neuhaus still
following a ridge line. (Last time, we took another turn down from that ridge
line towards the Bodenschneid and Tegernsee.) This descent only takes us 1:45h;
despite the signs saying it would take three hours. In total we spend about
6:50h hiking, ascended 1950m and descended 1875m.
