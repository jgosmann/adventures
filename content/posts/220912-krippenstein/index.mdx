Finally, the weather is nice again. In the valleys it is still cloudy in the
morning, but the gondala takes us up above the clouds onto the Krippenstein.

We lose the approach trail to today's via ferrata twice. A very visible yellow
plastic cable along the first part of the trail, but then going in a different
direction, is confusing because the trail markings itself are also yellow.

After about 30 minutes we found the start of the Himmeleck via ferrata. This
first part is pretty easy with a maximum difficulty of A/B, but the views are
pretty.

The Himmeleck via ferrata ends at a chamois sculpture that we reach after about
50 minutes. I use that place to change from my mountain boots into climbing
shoes.

The via ferrata splits in two here. My parents will do the Gams (“chamois“) via
ferrata (C), whereas I will do the Northface ferrata rated with E.

After a traverse into the North face, the difficult part starts with a rope ladder.
It is only rated as difficulty B, but the rungs are made from slippery aluminium
and it is slightly overhanging. Thus, it requires quite a bit of arm strength. In
contrast, the following C/D part is in a corner and efficiently climbed you can
almost always stand on your feet.

It follow two D/E spots, some easier climbing, and a short E crux. Shortly before
it, one can see the “five fingers” viewing platform where the via ferratas end.
I reach it after about an hour and having climbed up 200m of elevation.

We have lunch (potato fritters,
[knödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del)) at a nearby lodge with view
of the Dachstein.

We use the afternoon for a hike through the karst landscape around the
Margschierf up here.

After about two hours and 350m of elevation up and down, we are back at the
gondola summit station. Back down in the valley, we have only 30 minutes to
walk to the train station. Exactly the time it took us to walk the distance
this morning. Luckily, it goes downhill now and we make it with 8 minutes to
spare.

During the evening at our holiday flat, we can observe a very pretty sunset.
