Today, we are climbing the Via ferrata Ettore Bovero, which goes up the Col Ros√†
and is opposite to the Punta Fiames, where we were yesterday. Again, we are
dropped off by the bus near Fiames.

At first, we are following a trail through the woods. As we get close to the via
ferrata, parts get more exposed and require some climbing. After two hours we
reach the start of the via ferrata.

The via ferrata is again somewhat demanding and has an alpine feel to it. In the
final bit, one has to climb some ladders and rocks without a protecting steel
cable, but it isn't exposed anymore.

At the summit, 75 minutes later, we have a lunch break before starting our descent.
This will take another two hours.

Again, we decide to walk back to Cortina instead of waiting an hour for the bus,
which takes about the same time.

In total, we walked for 6:15h, ascended about 970m, and descended about 1035m.
