I sleep longer than I expected and wake up past 7am. I get dressed and search
for a nice spot to dig a hole as toilet. This early, no one else is up here and
cover isn't really needed. I can enjoy nice view as I take care of business.
Afterwards, I hike back up to the hut to have breakfast.

After breakfast and with a light backpack, I start my ascent of the Breitenkopf
(2469m). At first it is pretty easy walking terrain even though there is no
marked trail. But then one has to get onto the plateau of rock forming the ridge
line. One can either go through a groove, that is still filled with snow, or
climb up to the right of it. I decide for the later. The rock is a bit chossy,
so one has to be careful. Not every handhold can be trusted.

Then I have to ascent through loose scree. It is quite tedious and with each
step up I slide down a little bit again. Though, there are some parts where
solid rock pokes through the scree where it is bit easier. Eventually, I make it
onto the ridge line and the view opens up into the depths on the other side.

The first part can be walked.

Then I climb up to a high point and suddenly the ground breaks away in front
of me. Continuing straight is not possible, but a little bit back it is
possible to downclimb on the side of the ridge line (a bit exposed) and cross
the notch.

After the notch, the crux of the tour awaits. Climbing up to the summit
in <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" /> terrain. Conveniently, there is a rope
hanging that clearly marks where to climb up.

Unfortunately, clouds appeared and I don't have a view from up here. Before it
might get too foggy, I start the descent back to the hut. Going down the scree,
however, is much more fun as you can often slide. But the solid rock sticking
out can now be treacherous as it can bring you to a sudden stop. After the scree
slope, I decide to downclimb through snowy groove. It has better visibility from
up here than the ascent climb and going down in the snow seems easier than going
up.

As I get closer to the hut, I see a couple of chamois including at least one
young one.

At the hut I have a break, pack up my remaining stuff, and tidy up. Then I cross
to the opposite side of the Igelskar and ascent to the Igelsscharte. There is
also a snow field that looked quite steep from far away, but turns out to be
pretty fine. From there I continue to ascent the Vordere Igelskopf (2224m,
“front hedgehog head”). It is also an unmarked trail, but barely requires
climbing. As I go up I see two other persons coming down. They are the first
humans I see today.

After a short break and enjoying the better view from this summit (the
Breitenkopf is still engulfed in a cloud), I descent back to the Igelsscharte
and then on the other side to the Brendlkar. At first slightly descending and
then roughly keeping a constant elevation, I circle around the Brendlkar between
the ridge lines. There are some chamois again keeping their distance.

After the first half of loose scree, I encounter more snow fields. They are not
much of a problem, except at the edge of one my back foot breaks in as I was
about to step onto some rock. I end up in the gap between the rock and snow with
my front foot still laying on the rock almost on the height of my head now.
Luckily, I was not injured, but I am a little bit stuck at first. With some
effort, however, I can wiggle myself out of there and continue.

Eventually I join a more popular hiking trail and start seeing other people
again. Up to here, it felt really remote and secluded. As I pass the Brendl lake,
I refill my water once more. It is a hot day and the temperature will increase
as I continue to descent.

This time I descent via the Immensteig which has a surprisingly alpine feel
given the much easier trails everywhere around this area. Just as I am finished
with the steep part, it suddenly starts to rain. At least I didn't carry my
rain jacket for nothing. Once everything is wet, it stops again and soon the sun
is back.

Back at the bus stop, I still have about 40 minutes that I use to get some food
and drink at the nearby restaurant. In total, I walked (and climbed) today for
about 7 hours, ascended almost 1000m and descended almost 2000m.
