Most of us do another full rest day. Only Jonas and me will climb a bit in the
afternoon. The morning we have a relaxed breakfast at the caf√© Sofranos. It is
our celebration of Jonas's birthday. I have the Kalymnian breakfast with bread,
goat cheese, honey, and greek yoghurt with dates.

After some lazy relaxing, Jonas and I drive to the Summertime crag where he
wants to try his project Mama Nota <Grade value="7a" system="french" />.

<Loc latlong={[37.01616, 26.95557]} zoom={14} />

We do a few warm ups. Unfortunately, the route Mama Nota is quite popular and
another group is having some goes on it. We get in line, but still have to wait
a bit. Thus, I do Summer Wine <Grade value="6b+" system="french" /> in the
meantime. It is slightly overhanging on parts with good holds. The length still
makes it pumpy. In one spot, I am not finding good feet, but more or less do
a pull up to avoid getting too pumped. Somehow this explodes the tape on my
forearm that I use as support with my Golfer's elbow. But while it isn't nice
technique, it gets me through the tough spot and I manage to onsight the route.

Now we can finally attempt Mama Nota. The other group is taking a break and we
may use their draws. Jonas goes first, but takes a fall. Then I try it. As you
might remember, <Link to="/posts/230524-kalymnos/">I tried it a few days
ago</Link> and could not get to the top. I fall again in the crux. But then
I immediately find some beta that works for me, though it is different from
everyone else I see on the route today. Then a person from the other group gives
it a final try, but also falls. As they are leaving he takes down the draws. It
is Jonas's turn again and he manages the sent without any problems, even while
putting up our own draws! That establishes the send train and I also do the
route next go (now that I found the beta for me). Unfortunately, the other group
has already left.

We make it back to Masouri just in time to join the drop-in yoga class.
Afterwards, we have dinner at Manifesto where I order the tasty roasted lemon
lamb.
