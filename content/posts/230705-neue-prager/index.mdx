Today, I leave for a five day alpine tour. I meet Fabian and Michael (whom I'm
meeting for the first time) in the train to Wörgl. They already boarded at
the Central station, whereas I join at Munich East closer to my home. In Wörgl
we change trains to Kitzbühel and from there we continue by bus. In theory, we
would have to go to Matrei and change buses there to go back to the Tauernhaus.
However, the bus driver is quite friendly and drops off as we pass the
Tauernhaus. That saves us quite some time. From there we start our ascent to the
Neue Prager Hütte (“new mountain cabin of Prague”, 2796m).

On a bench along the way, we have a break and then, at the Alte Prager
Hütte (“old mountain cabin of Prague“), we have second short break.

After about 3:30h, about 1200 meters elevation gain, and one break in-between,
we reach the cabin. We enjoy the sun on the terrace for while until we are found
by Margret. She is the fourth person joining us, has already been a few days
in the mountains to acclimatise and arrived before us.

We then continue to check-in. It turns out that only three beds instead of four
were reserved for us. Martin and Kristina dropped out from the tour and asked me
if I wanted to replace them. Apparently, Fabian thought they would sign me up,
but I only explicitly told Fabian that I will join. Luckily, there is still
a free bed. Even the fourth person they put into our four bed room happily
switches to another room so that we can all sleep in the same room.

Once these formalities are handled, we go back to main room where we meet Franz,
our mountain guide, and another Martin, who is mentored by Franz and will assist
him. The group I am joining goes on a trip with Franz as guide every year since
a couple of years. He asks me a few questions about my experience with alpine
tours and I have to show him the fit of my crampons (which is fine). Then it is
time for dinner (roast pork). Soon afterwards, we go to bed. We have an early
start tomorrow.
