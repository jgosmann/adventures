The weather forecast said that there will be some rain and potentially
thunderstorms starting some time around 11am to 12am. Thus, we decided for
a short tour to the Gstanskopf (2730m).

We start hiking shortly before 8am. The trail is still quite wet from nightly
rain and there are many salamanders on it. We have to pay a bit of attention to
not accidentally step on one.

Quarter past nine, we reach a saddle. Here we leave the trail and follow the
ridge line East. There a few spots requiring the use of hands, but I wouldn't
call it real climbing, rather some scrambling. It is mostly steep grassy slopes.

After less than two hours, we reach the summit. We have short break with still
a lot of sun. But we can see the clouds in the distance. As we descend back to
hut, the sky turns cloudy. With the first drops of rain, quarter to noon, we
reach the cabin. Perfect timing!

We spent another relaxed afternoon in the cabin. Later the weather improves
again and we can spend some time in deck chairs outside.
