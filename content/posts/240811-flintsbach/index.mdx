Another weekend with sunny and hot weather. My colleague Marco and I decided to
use it for some climbing in Flintsbach, which is shady and makes the temperature
bearable.

<Loc latlong={[47.71756, 12.12464]} />

We start on the what we thought to be the route Kinderleicht (“child's
play”) <Grade system="UIAA" value="6-" />. It starts out easy enough, indeed.
But at an overhang it gets tricky. In the end, I don't climb the overhang, but
follow another close bolt line around it onto some slab that is a bit easier,
though still not super easy. Later, we figure out that the topo is imprecise and
we actually started on 100 Kilo Liebe (“100 kilograms of love”) <Grade
system="UIAA" value="7+" />. Indeed, this route crosses with another route, so
I ended up following the actual correct bolt line. Still, the assigned grade is
weird. While it felt harder than <Grade system="UIAA" value="6-" /> , it did not
seem as hard as <Grade system="UIAA" value="7+" /> by a large margin. Maybe we
climbed it too far to the right. In any case, I had to update the post
about <Link to="/posts/240512-flintsbach/">last time in Flintsbach</Link> to
correct for the misidentified routes.

We continue with a bunch of other moderate routes around <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6" /> in the sector. There is also one more <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7+" /> that we try, but it is mostly way easier and only has a harder
boulder on top, whicch isn't that hard if you keep a bit to the left. Maybe that
is not intended as it brings you a bit into the neighboring route, but keeping
to the right really makes the route feel unnatural.

Because it is a great route, we also get on Animals <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7+" />, which I onsighted <Link to="/posts/240512-flintsbach/">last
time</Link>. Today, it feels much harder (maybe due to the heat), and I don't
manage to climb it clean.

We then move back to do two more easy routes. I end with Früchte der Saison
(“fruits of the season”) <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+/7-" />. The start has
some awkward moves, then you get to a good rest from where you have a really
tricky move leading to some excellent climbing on grippy rock. It took me quite
a while to figure out that tricky move, and a bail biner in the bolt on that
height indicates that other people gave up on it.
