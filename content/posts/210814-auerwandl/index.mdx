It might be the hottest day of the year, but Vroni, Vesna, and I decide to go
sport climbing anyways. Though, mostly easy stuff. To avoid getting stuck in
traffic, we leave a 7am for the Auerwandl near Lake Chiemsee.

While Vroni has been bouldering for quite a while, she is fairly new to sport
climbing. In particular, it is her first time on sport climbing on actual rock.
Thus, we start with some really easy routes: Kinderturnen
(“child gymnastics”) <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" /> and
Baby Gwag <Grade system="UIAA" value="3+" />. Next we do
Hot Dog <Grade system="UIAA" value="6-" />. The route is pretty
easy almost all the way to the top before you have to get through a short crux.
This gives me some trouble initially and I do not send it cleanly.

I almost onsight Amigo <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" /> afterwards, but mess
up the last two moves. The subjective crux was actually right at the bottom with
a quite easy middle part again and then a slightly harder top.

The crag is not only popular with climbers, but also butterflies. One took a
liking in my helmet and was sitting on it for a few routes. A scrub at the base
of the wall is even more loved by the butterflies and I can count at least
a dozen on it. Better than any butterfly conservatory!

My final route today is Alpinfuchs <Grade system="UIAA" value="6" />. It has a good
no-hands rest below the crux. So I can climb into the crux and back down
multiple times until I figure it out and get the onsight. The route is really
nice corner climbing and some layback moves that you do not really get in gym
climbing. However, I am unable to convince the other two to also try it.

Instead we drive to Lake Chiemsee where we have something to drink and/or eat
before going for a swim to finish off the day. A really nice refreshment after
the climbing!
