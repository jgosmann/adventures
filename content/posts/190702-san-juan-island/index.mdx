Another relaxed day spending the morning in the hot tub with a light drizzle of
rain. After a lunch consisting of left-overs, we visit the local cider producer
and distillery for tasting. They have good ciders (on the dry side, one of them
actually has no sweetness at all), an amazing
[pommeau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommeau), gin (one that tastes like the
island air), and other interersting liquors such as rhubarb brandy and ginger
liquor.
