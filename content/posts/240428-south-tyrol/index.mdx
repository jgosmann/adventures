Because of the rainy weather, we sleep in and have a long breakfast. Then, we
(except Alex, Steffi, and their baby) drive down to Moos. First, we check out
a small crag, basically directly in the village, to see if it's worth to go
there on some drier day. Next, we start a hike to St Leonhard through the gorge
known as the Passerschluchtenweg. It presents itself with some nice views and it
is no longer raining. I'm quite struck by the deep, narrow valleys between
the imposing mountain ranges.

In St Leonhard, we stop at an inn and divide two pizzas among us five. They are
quite delicious. Afterwards, we take the bus back to our starting point. The bus
schedule is surprisingly good with a connection every 30 minutes.

Back home, we have a self-made vegetarian chili for dinner and play some board
games.
