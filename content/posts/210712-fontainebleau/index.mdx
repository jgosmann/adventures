Today we wake up even later, but it is raining anyways. Around noon the rain
gets a bit less and we decide to go for a walk into the forest. On the way to
there, we meet our Airbnb host who recommends to us a trail with some nice views
over the forest. It turns out pretty nice with varied vegetation and all sorts
of rocks to climb over, around, and in-between. It seems that the trail often
goes over or through the rocks on purpose instead of the easier way around.

Eventually we decide to cut back via a different trail. Otherwise, it would take
us about six hours to complete the whole loop. It also has dried up a bit and we
stop at a nearby exposed boulder field named Cul de Chien, next to a giant patch
of sand. There we boulder until it starts to rain again. My hardest send today
is Épreuve de Force <Grade system="Fb" value="5c" />.

Eventually, it starts to rain again and we had back. Thanks to our “excellent”
planning, we need to do another grocery run afterwards. Then we spend the
remaining evening with board games and trying to order pizza. Unfortunately, all
places are either closed on Monday or do not deliver to where we are. Thus, we
just use eat the food we have in the house for dinner.
