I was staying in Vienna the last few days for the EuroRust conference. Thus, it
made sense to add a few days for some sightseeing. On the morning of a nice,
sunny day, I start in the city center with one of the main sights, the St.
Stephan's Cathedral.

You can visit the two tower's of the cathedral to get a nice view over the city.
I decided for the slightly cheaper one, where you have to climb 343 steps. The
other tower has an elevator.

Next, I take a stroll through city center with many high-priced boutiques.

Shortly before noon, I make it to the famous Anker clock. At noon some figurines
are supposed to be walking along it, but nothing moves and the displayed time is
quite off. Seems like it is broken.

So I continue with my stroll through the city.

I continue through the Spittelberg quarter with its narrow streets. When leaving
the quarter, I pass an old flak tower that has been repurposed as a rock
climbing wall.

From here, it is not far to the river Wien where some nice art nouveau houses can
be found.

Through a market, the Naschmarkt, I make my way back towards the Karlsplatz near
the city center. There is another church here (the Karlskirche) and a small art
nouveau pavilion.

Now it is time for a late lunch. I get a traditional Viennese Schnitzel.
Afterwards, I take the tram to the Museum of Art Fakes. It is small, but has
a fine exhibition. Not far from here is a building designed by Hundertwasser
that I take a look at next.

As the sun is sinking lower, I make my way to the Prater: a huge space of
greenery in the city. I walk a bit through it, making my way to the west end
where they have a permanent amusement park. You have to pay no entrance, but pay
for the rides individually. I'm a little bit tempted; it has been ages that
I rode a roller coaster. But in the end, I save my money. It is nice to take in
the flair anyways.

Because it is just two stops with the subway, I pay the island in the Danube
a little evening visit before calling it a day and getting back to my hotel.
