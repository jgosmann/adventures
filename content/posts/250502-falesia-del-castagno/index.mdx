Today we visit Falesia del castagno. The parking is at a climber's café, so we
have breakfast there. It is convenient as we are out of bread at home and
couldn't buy anything yesterday due to the public holiday.

At the crag are quite a few Italian parties (so far we mostly met German and
Austrian climbers). It turns out that Italian belaying is an absolute shit show.
No one of them is belaying properly (like keeping the hand at the
brake strand).

I warm up on Il ricordo di fil <Grade system="french" value="6a" />, a beautiful
corner with a crack, and Silhoutte <Grade system="french" value="6a+" />,
another nice crack. Next is one of the classics of the crag, Stardust <Grade
system="french" value="6b" />, a great line on pockets and crimps that I can
onsight.

Feeling confident from that success, I try The Time Machine <Grade
system="french" value="6c+" />, which has a few hard moves in the beginning, but
is easier afterwards. I can send it on my second try.

Eventually, I give Galactic Mantra <Grade system="french" value="7a+" />,
another classic of the crag, a try. It is indeed a great, long line. Supposedly
the hard bit as about three-quarters of the height according to the guide book.
However, for me the slabby start on very minuscule holds and feet is clearly the
hardest part. It is also quite scary because a fall with only the first draw
clipped is never nice. I give it a second try, but this gives me even more
trouble at the start and once I get through it the second time, I'm way too
tired.

Afterwards, I even need a second try on the <Grade system="french" value="6a+"
/> route The Power of Love. According to the guide book, the route is “a must”.
But it turns out way overrated and not that great.
