Another warm spring day means another climbing day. We planned to go to
the <Link to="/posts/210814-auerwandl/">Auerwandl</Link>, but on the way there
we (Anja, Jonas, and me) learn that it is currently closed because of rock fall
danger. Thus, we flip through the guidebook to find another nearby crag and
decide for the Pleitewandl.

<Loc latlong={[47.706282, 12.486887]} />

We walk to the sector farthest in, where we warm up with Kriegspfad
(“warpath“) <Grade system="UIAA" value="6" /> and Grauer Hirsch (“gray
deer”) <Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />. The second route has a bit longer run
outs and is a bit committing, but good fun. Afterwards, we try a route with an
off-width crack that isn't listed in the guidebook. That makes the climbing a
bit unusual, but I suspect the grade is only
around <Grade system="UIAA" value="6" />, probably at
most <Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />.

Next Jonas and me try a <Grade system="UIAA" value="7" /> that is listed in the
guide book, but without a name. It takes me a while to figure out the beta.
Especially one essential foot hold is hard to discover as it is in a depression
of the wall where it isn't visible from above. Nevertheless, I can redpoint it
on my second try.

As last route in the sector, we get on Komet <Grade system="UIAA" value="7" />.
It is fairly easy up to a roof. The guidebooks claims some jugs in
there, but both Jonas and me struggle and eventually give up, and use the
alternate <Grade system="UIAA" value="5-" /> exit. Even though I think I roughly
know how to climb it now, it might require hanging with all your weight on
some painful holds for a moment. All in all, it feels quite sandbagged.

We finish the day at Ra's Sonnenpfeiler (“Ra's sun pillar”) <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6-" /> (only first pitch) which is nice and enjoyable in the evening sun.
Only the start is a bit dicey because you don't want to fall before clipping the
first draw, but the moves aren't that obvious or easy.

After dinner at a local inn, we head back to Munich.
