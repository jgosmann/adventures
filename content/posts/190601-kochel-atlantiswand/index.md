Summer is finally here and I went out climbing again with Jason and Lisa. This
time near Kochel at the Atlantiswand (“Atlantis wall”). Besides lead climbing
there is also some bouldering around and people seem to stash their (old?) crash
pads under the bottom part of the wall.

But we stuck to lead climbing. After warming up on Scherzhaft Männlich (UIAA 5+,
YDS 5.8), I tried Sog ins Nichts (UIAA 8, 5.11d) on top rope. A quite nice route
that I might be able to do clean with some projecting. But then I focussed on
Das Ramayani Kapitel 10 o.S. (UIAA 7+, YDS 5.11a) that a could redpoint on my
third try after one try of working out the beta and one try of accidentally
slipping of on one of the last crux moves.
