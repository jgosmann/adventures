My vacation starts with waking up before sunrise to catch an early flight at
8am. Admitted, 8am is not that early, but it is always good to be early for an
international flight. Especially if your luggage looks like this, in order to
check-in two backpacks as a single item (in combination they are still below
the size and weight restrictions):

This works without complaints, I only had to find the bulky luggage counter.

After a short layover in Frankfurt, I board a ten hour flight to Seattle/Tacoma
(“Seatac”) that is as enjoyable as such a long flight can be. It helps that the
seat next to me is free.

Once I arrive in Seatac, I unfortunately have to wait a long time in a hallway
because the immigration hall is “at capacity”. When I finally make through,
though, I surprisingly get a really friendly immigration officer to talk to.

After picking up my luggage, my friends Peter, his dad David, Alex, Yvonne, and
Pants pick me up from the airport. The next stop is the Seattle REI to stock up
on freeze-dried meals and some outdoor equipment for an upcoming part of the
trip. Then we continue to drive a little bit up north to the San Juan Island
ferry in Anacortes. On the way, we pass four (!) accidents, one of which could
have been in a movie: we see a a white car speeding along the shoulder on the
right, then swirving to the left into traffic, shortly after followed by
a police car. Not long after, we pass an accident caused by that car involving
a motorcycle. Luckily it seems that no one got hurt! But the driver of that car
seems to have run. This definitely did not help to instill any more confidence
in the US highways than I had before.

Unfortunately, we barely miss the next ferry to San Juan Island and have to wait
about two more hours. We pass the time by playing a bit of Frisbee, talking to
a guy who rode is bicycle up from San Francisco, and ordering some Chinese food.
On the ferry, I finally get hit by the jetlag and doze off for most of the time,
but still regain consciousness to see the sunset.

When we finally arrive at Peter's parent's house, we go to sleep soon, but not
before listening to the nighthawks for a while on the deck. Every once in
a while, one of these birds [goes into a deep dive making a unique
sound](https://youtu.be/E-_CDXH9qhY).
