It is raining. Thus, we go back to the overhanging routes that stay dry in rain
located in the Cheakamus Canyon. Because of the overhanging nature of the rock,
the routes are quite hard. But they have fixed draws, which means you can try
them without losing gear if you cannot finish them.

We start with Face the Music (<Grade system="YDS" value="5.12a" />). It has a lower crux for me that I can
figure out and another crux not far from the anchors. I figure out the beta, but
cannot pull of the moves. My reach always ends up a little bit too short, but it
might be doable with more practice.

Next we try Mrs. Negative (<Grade system="YDS" value="5.12a" />), a pretty short route consisting out of
essentially two boulder problems separated by a good rest. Unexpectedly, I make
it through the first boulder problem without much trouble. It takes me a few
attempts to figure out the second part, that also feels doable except for the
very top. I cannot make it to the anchors. Maybe this is because the top is
soaking wet from the rain or maybe those moves are just hard. I give the route
a second ground-up try, but it feels harder than the first time. Am
I already getting tired? This route felt doable with enough practice (except
maybe the top) on the first try, but now I am not so sure anymore.

The third route, we try today, is The Neutered Bovine (<Grade system="YDS" value="5.11c" />). I tried it
already about two years ago, but had to bail because it was affecting an injured
finger. Now I want to see how it feels with that finger being fine again. Turns
out it feels as hard as the <Grade system="YDS" value="5.12a" /> routes to me and I do not finish it.
Christine, however, makes it up all the way. Impressive!

I give Face the Music another try before we leave as I feel quite rested. But
on the wall I notice quickly that I am actually more tired than my body made me
believe on the ground.

Anyways, a good day, taking many falls and getting comfortable with it.
