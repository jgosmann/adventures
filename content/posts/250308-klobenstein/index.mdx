An exceptionally warm weekend made a climbing outing a must. We (Jonas, Anja,
Antoine, Anna, and me) decided to enjoy the splendid weather in Klobenstein. In
the sun, it even was almost too hot.

After two easier warm ups (one I had done already <Link
to="/posts/240406-klobenstein/">last year</Link>), I start to work on
Katzensprung <Grade system="UIAA" value="8-" />. The main crux is a bulge fairly
low. From a side-pull on your right, you have to reach for a hold to your left
and slightly above, then you have to move your right hand without ending up in
a barn door. With an intermediary crimp and the right foot placement, I manage
to do that. Then you have to pull yourself in with your right hand on another
slippery crimp, lock off, reach for a two-finger pocket with your left, and
finally throw for the good ledge (are rather the good spot of the not-so-good
ledge that you need to know; I suppose that is the cat jump, the name is hinting
at). It took me a while to figure all of this out. Higher up I find a second,
but easier crux that is also gets much more friendly with the right beta. On my
third try, I get the clean send. In-between, another climber hops on the route,
but uses completely different beta than me. In the first crux, he more or less
escapes into the close neighbouring route to circumvent the crux, but then goes
straight through the upper crux which looks like a much harder variant.

After a relaxed plaisir route, I finish the day off with HG Stoaner <Grade
system="UIAA" value="7+" />. With some beta from Jonas, I can flash the route. It
also has only a short crux and is pleasant climbing afterwards.

The sun is gone by now, so we head back to Munich and have dinner together
before getting some rest.
