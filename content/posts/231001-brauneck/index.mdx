Despite it already being the first day of October, we still have quite sunny and
warm weather. Fabian and I use that for some climbing at the Brauneck.

<Loc latlong={[47.65771, 11.50764]} />

After the long and steep ascent from Lenggries, we warm up on the multipitch
route “Luhja! Sacklezement Hahleluja”. The first two pitches are not harder
than <Grade system="UIAA" value="4+" />, followed by a <Grade
  system="UIAA"
  value="6-"
/> pitch.

After climbing the great “Phantastique — Phantastique“ <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6" />, we want to get on
“Steinbrecher” <Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />. Even though the start is
marked, we have trouble finding the right line. There are three bolt lines close
together and the topo is hard to match to the actual rock. After each of us
considered the left line too spicy, I orient myself more to the right and
eventually climb the right-most of the three lines. It turns out to be the
correct line with quite engaging climbing. The crux is shortly before the end
and a bit committing.

Our final route is “DeConniA” <Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />. In the top
part there are again three close bolt lines and it is again unclear which one is
the right one. I think in the end I picked the correct line, but I find it to be
quite hard and cannot climb it cleanly.

Then it is already half past five and time to walk back down.
