This Thursday is a holiday in Bavaria and the weather forecast looks excellent.
Maybe summer finally arrived after a lousy May (I suppose it needed to average
out the exceptionally good weather in April last year?). Though, it is supposed
to rain again at the weekend. Anyways, the good weather window has to be used,
so I teamed up with Wolfgang who I found via the German Alpine Club's bulletin
board.

We leave Munich early around 7am to avoid the main traffic. It also allows us
to get one of the few free parking spots in Oberammergau.

First, we hike up the mountain Kofel for about 45 minutes. This early we are
still the only ones on the steep trail. With the weight of all the metal
equipment and rope on the back, I question my life choices. Why do I carry all
of that stuff up there again? I'm not really used to this kind of approach from
my time in Canada where things were much flatter. Then we leave the official
trail, and scramble up some <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" /> terrain until we
get to the actual beginning of the three-pitch climbing route Linke Achsel
(“left armpit”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="4-" />). We swing the leads,
starting with Wolfgang. The climbing is not very hard, but nice. Definitely the
more interesting way than the hiking trail to make it to the summit. I think my
life choices are fine.

We reach the summit before 10:30am and have a short break before descending
a bit and than turning to the Kofelturm (“Kofel tower”). Here we want to climb
another two-pitch route, the Normalweg (“normal path”, usually the easiest
climbing route up a peak, <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />). However, a family
with two kids is already in the route and we have to wait a bit before we can
start.

I am a bit surprised that despite the grade difference being only a minus,
this route is quite a bit more sustained. But it does not pose a problem to
me. To get back down, we have rappel.

Next, I climb the Reindlkante (“Reindl arête”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="5+"
/>). It turns out to be not as easy as I thought and the crux takes me some mental
strength to keep it together and make my way up there. The last bolt
being already 3 meters below does not help. But I manage to do it
without falling. Wolfgang being not as strong of a climber difficulty-wise
foregoes this route.

We then descend the Kofel passing masses of normal foot folk on the hiking
trail. Being a climber can make you feel a little bit elitist compared
to them. To finish things off, we climb two more unnamed routes in the nearby
Klettergarten (sport climbing crag) Frauenwasserl.
