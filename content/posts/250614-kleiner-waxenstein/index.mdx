Perfectly sunny, even though quite hot, weather like on this Saturday must be made
use of. Thus, Vroni and I climb the Kleine Waxenstein (2136m). From Hammersbach,
we first ascent on a normal hiking trail and some gravel roads. Eventually we
reach the scree field of the Mittagsreiße. First we continue on a trail left of it,
then crossover to the right side, and eventually just climb over the bigger
blocks in the scree field itself. From there it gets steeper and we need some
our hands a bit to climb up to the saddle between the Manndl (1889m) and the Kleiner
Waxenstein. Now we follow the ridge line with more climbing spots up to <Grade
system="UIAA" value="2" />, always following the easiest path and the traces of
polished rock.

After a relaxed break on the summit, with a nice view of Garmisch-Partenkirchen,
the Höllental (“hell valley”), and the Zugspitze (Germany's highest mountain),
we descent along the same way. Going down it turns out to be a bit more
difficult to find. At some spots, we have to look around a bit to find the
correct path. However, the spot where the guidebook said to make sure to
remember it well because it is hard to find on the way down, is easily found.
Back at the saddle, we visit also the summit of the Manndl shortly before
continuing all the way down.
