On our last climbing day on Kalymnos, we go once more to Griffig together with
Susi and Jörg.

<Loc latlong={[36.99571, 26.95621]} zoom={14} />

After the first warm ups, I climb The Dentist Terror <Grade value="6c"
system="french" />. It has many pockets like holes in your teeth. Get it?

Susi and Jörg got onto Suchspiel <Grade value="7a+" system="french" /> in the
meantime. I also try it. They tell me that I have to go right in the crimpy
crux, but that was bad beta and I take a fall. I then get it on the second try
by staying left.

Next Susi and Jörg get on Timba Climber <Grade value="7b" system="french" /> and
I follow their lead. The bottom part is not as bad as expected and has some cool
moves. But the crux appears quite hard on some bad crimps. I need multiple tries
to make it past it. Surprisingly, I make it through the crux on my second try
ground up. Unfortunately, my foot slips just before the finish. Luckily, I have
a good handhold and manage to stay on and get the redpoint. It is funny, that
along the route little pennies are glued to the wall sort of guiding your way.

Afterwards, I do Lou + Zoe <Grade value="6c+" system="french" /> It starts with
a few hard, bouldery moves. On my first try my foot pops and I take an
uncomfortable fall at the first bolt. The second try I succeed. Even though, it
is easier after that first boulder, the top should not be underestimated.

The final climb of the trip for me is Sauna am See <Grade value="6b+"
system="french" />. It again has a hard start with a roof, but gets quite easy
afterwards. Interestingly, my beta is quite a bit different from Jonas's as you
can see in the videos below.

Unfortunately, it is time to call it day and we have to descent.

For dinner, we drive to Vathys where we share two big fish. Across the bay we can
see Turkey.
