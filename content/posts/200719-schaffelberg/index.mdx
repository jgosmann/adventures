Another colleague from work, his girlfriend, a friend of theirs and I went to
the Schaffelberg by Oberammergau for some sport climbing on this Sunday.

From the parking lot we reach the crag after about 30 minutes of uphill hiking.
Enough to already get soaked in sweat even though it is not that warm yet.
Unfortunately, we discover that many routes still have large wet patches, but we
find a few that are sufficiently dry. Later in the day the sun comes around the
cliff and peaks through the cloud, letting a few more spots dry, but also
making it quite hot. The climbing is quite fun and I liked almost every route
I got on. Though, I still need to rebuild some power endurance after not being
able to climb a lot last year and getting hit by the Corona lockdown just when
I was just starting to increase my climbing volume again. This, and also a bit
of unfamiliar rock structures, keep my onsight grade lower than it used to be
for now.

After being tired from climbing, we take a stroll into Oberammergau where we
have some delecious ice cream. I decide for the flavours goat's milk and prickly pear.
