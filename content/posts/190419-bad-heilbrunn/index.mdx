My parents visited me over Easter in Munich and I took them climbing outdoors
for the first time. It was also my first time of proper rock climbing (sport
climbing) near the Alps. We decided for the discontinued quarry near Bad
Heilbrunn with lots of easy and mostly slab climbs.

<Loc latlong={[47.7548, 11.4486]} />

Our first warmup route was the Radlweg (<Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />). Roughly translates to
“bicycle trail” as you follow a relatively wide uprunning ledge.

Then we did Schwarzer Riss (“black crack”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />) with a surprisingly
hard crux for the grade.

Finally, we did the Weberknecht Verschneidung (“Harvestman corner”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />) which is a really nice climb despite the low grade.

My parents enjoyed their first outdoor climb a lot and I hope to squeeze in some
more climbing around Munich this summer.
