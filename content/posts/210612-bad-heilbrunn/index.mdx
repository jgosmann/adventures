Today, Wolfgang and I have some more sport climbing planned in Bad Heilbrunn (I
have been there <Link to="/posts/190419-bad-heilbrunn">once before</Link>). Due
to some time constraints, we can only start around noon and because it is
supposed to rain later, a full blown multi-pitch tour does not make sense.

<Loc latlong={[47.7548, 11.4486]} />

We start on the left side of the main slab with Direkter Einstieg ( “direct
entry”, named that because the route goes straight up joining another route that
traverses from the left, <Grade system="UIAA" value="4+" />). Due to the slabby
nature it feels a bit scary. We then continue to progress to the right with routes
slowly increasing in difficulty. The highlight is Fast wie in Sachsen
(“almost like in Saxony”, a reference to a German sandstone region with a long
climbing tradition, <Grade system="UIAA" value="6-" />).

Starting to feel more confident on the slab, I decide to try Ines (<Grade
system="UIAA" value="7" />), but end up reading the topo wrong and I start
Kondensstreifen (“condensation trail”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />) to
then transition into Dachl-Schreck (“roof scare”, <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7-" />). This variant turns out to be quite spicy. In the end, I am
stumped by the slab slightly below the crux and cannot find a solution. Thus,
I transition back to Kondenstreifen and battle my way up there (not even close
to a clean ascent).

To finish off the day, we do two more routes: Steffi (<Grade system="UIAA"
value="6" />), which surprisingly feels easier than the next route, and Otto
Flugplatte (“Otto flying-slab“, <Grade system="UIAA" value="6-" />).

Somehow we did not get caught in any rain all day, even though some roads
are definitely wet on the way back.
