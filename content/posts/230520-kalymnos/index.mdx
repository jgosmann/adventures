We have breakfast after a visit to the grocery store. Unfortunately, the
apartment is not outfitted well with kitchen utensils and we are missing
a bread knife. Given the consistency of the greek bread, this makes it very hard
to cut proper slices. In the next days we will stick to bread which as closer to
a baguette in shape and lends itself better to cutting.

Today we visit the Ghost Kitchen crag, that was recommended to us at yesterday's
dinner. I warm up on Joy in the Garden <Grade value="6a+" system="french" />,
a very fun climb.

Next I jump on Taverna Psirri <Grade value="6b" system="french" /> which is
slabby with a dicey start and a very cool conglomerate rock at the top. It is
not at all like the conglomerate that we get around Munich, which is like a pile
of pebbles glued together and not my favourite at all, but much more compact
with good ledges and a real joy.

So far I am feeling quite confident on the climbs (the dense bolting here
definitely helps) and my elbow is filling fine (I am troubled with Golfer's
elbow since the start of this year). Thus, I up the difficulty and try Resista

<Grade value="6c" system="french" />. It is a committing, slightly overhanging
route on quite large and good pockets. The moves are really cool and I am
excited that I manage to onsight this route.

Now the crag is getting into the sun and it gets quite hot. We decide to call it
a day and drive to the nearby pirate beach where we have some drinks, a swim,
and relax.

We have dinner at Manifesto where I try the Kalymnian goat. It is quite tasty.
