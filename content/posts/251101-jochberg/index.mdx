A surprisingly warm fall day made me join a hike of a group of the alpine club
today. Quarter past seven, we leave Munich as a group of four. Our goal is the
Jochberg (1565m). <Link to="/posts/200807-jochberg/">I have been on it
before</Link>, but today we are coming from Jachenau, which is the other side
where there are much less people on the trail.

It is actually pretty quiet as we walk through the fall landscape. Only at the
summit it is crowded as one has to expect here. The hike is quite easy, but
nevertheless enjoyable. Especially as I'm still affected from a cold that I had
last week, I'm happy that it is not strenuous and I can still get out with the
nice weather.

The hike took us a bit more than 4h and involved an elevation difference of
800m.
