Today we decided to climb at the Tempio del vento (“temple of the wind”).
According to the guidebook the name is a joke and it is supposedly pretty
protected against the wind. But as it turns out, the guidebook is wrong and it
is quite windy. Thus, it is a bit cold despite the sunny weather.

The approach is quite beautiful leading through a gorge and some dense,
overgrown forest.

Also the climbing routes are excellent. I really enjoy every single route today.
I start with Chinottonic <Grade system="french" value="5c" />. It follows the
curved edge of cave and gives great views across the valleys. The name refers to
Chinotto, a [bitter tasting orange-like citrus
fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus_myrtifolia), from which
a [soft-drink](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinotto_(drink)>) is produced.
I suppose a Chinottonic is then mixed with tonic water?

Quite nice are also La Pennavaira puo aspettare <Grade system="french"
value="6a+" />, a long route with overhanging, slabby, and corner parts; and
Morbida Sarucia <Grade system="french" value="6b" />, which has a nice overhang
and a technical slabby traverse.

Next I try Lejonidass <Grade system="french" value="7a+" />. It connects two
easier routes through a roof and has thus just a single crux. Somehow I manage
to onsight the route, my hardest onsight so far. However, it did not feel that
hard, and given that it has only a single short crux, the route should probably
be downgraded (maybe to <Grade system="french" value="6c+" />), and others seem
to agree on the Internet. Afterwards, I also climb Tempio del Fumo <Grade
system="french" value="6a" /> which is one of the routes connected by
Lejonidass.

Also, the corner and crack of Asura mentale <Grade system="french" value="6b" />,
as well as Es Rütli fur di! <Grade system="french" value="6c" />, which I send on my
second try, are really nice. The latter starts with an overhang and then turns
into a slab with crimps and pockets.

To refill our energy depots, we have pizza, desert, and ice cream for dinner.
Inspired by today's warm up route, I try the Chinotto drink (without tonic
water) and like it. It has a slightly bitter taste and somewhat malty (?)
flavour.
