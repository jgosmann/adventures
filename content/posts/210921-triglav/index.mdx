At breakfast, you have to pay for each single slice of bread, package of jam,
etc. because the hut is supplied by helicopter. But you can also order two eggs
or eggs with ham which seems to have a better cost to nutrients ratio. So we
decide for these options with an additional slice of bread.

Today we will do a tour with light backpacks as we will stay another night in
the same hut. We will traverse the ridge line, the hut is on, to the Veliko
Špičje (2398m), then descend into the Seven Lakes Valley, and hike back to the
hut.

But first we need drinking water. Luckily, there is a clean mountain lake 10
minutes below the hut. So we go there and fill up. To be extra-safe we purify it
with Micropur in addition.

About half an hour later, we start our actual hike. It leads first over compact
rock before ascending the face of the ridge line. That in turn leads to
incredible views. The opposite side of the ridge line has a steep drop-off.

The hiking guide categorized this as a hike of medium difficulty. Turns out the
scale is a bit shifted in Slovenia. In Germany this would have been categorized
as a difficult hike because of some climbing passages and somewhat exposed
traverses on thin ledges.

Then, we got lucky and found an [Edelweiß](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leontopodium_nivale).
The alpine flower that has become a symbol for alpinism, is used in the logos of
many alpine associations (such as the German Alpine club), and sometimes is even
a national symbol. However, it has become quite rare (especially in the Northern
alps) and some never find one despite many trips into the alps.

Soon we find another Edelweiß, and another, and then so many that we stop
counting. I suppose the trail leads through the ideal habitat (grassy rock
lands), but is difficult enough to deter the majority of hikers (we do not meet
anyone on this trail) who could step on the flowers or pick them (even though
it is forbidden in many countries).

Eventually, we make it to the summit and enjoy the views.

After a while we descend into the Seven Lakes Valley. On the trail to the
summit, the map showed a via ferrata. But there were only 4 steel rungs and no
steel cable on the whole trail. But now, during the descend, we come across
a short stretch with a steel rope that is not marked in map.

As we get lower it starts to get greener until we are low enough for trees to
grow again.

The first lake, that we pass, does not actually belong to the seven lakes in the
valley, but it is idyllic nevertheless.

Then we get to the largest of the seven lakes.

When we get back to hut (after 4:45 of hiking, and about 900m elevation gain and
loss), it is much busier than yesterday. Apparently, people finally noticed that
the weather improved and made quick plans for mountain trips. The guests are
quite international again. After dinner (bean soup with sausage and Slovenien
cake with poppy seeds), together with a German couple, we play a dice game
([Dice 10000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_10000)) and some rounds of the
card game [Skat](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)>), the national
game of Germany.
