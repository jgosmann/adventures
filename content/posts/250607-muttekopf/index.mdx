Dark clouds are hanging in the mountains and, according to the forecast, rain
will start around noon. Thus, the weather is not really suitable to climbing.
Instead we decide to hike up the Muttekopf (2774m), the mountain that the cabin
is named after.

On the way up, we pass some herds of goats and sheep. It still stays mostly dry,
but there is quite some moisture in the air.

On the way done is starts raining a bit at first, and later quite heavily.
Eventually it turns out that my waterproof shoes aren't completely waterproof
anymore. The herd of goats gathered under a rock ledge. Apparently, they don't
like to get wet either.

Around lunch time, we're back in the hut, put our stuff into the drying
room and order something for lunch. The afternoon is spent with some games,
before we are served some great risotto for dinner.
