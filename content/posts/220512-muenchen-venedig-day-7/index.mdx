Today I will make it to Venice. But first I have to go through Treviso.
Navigating its streets is slightly more complex. Also because the signage of
the cycle route starts getting a bit worse again compared to South Tyrol.
Occasionally, a sign might even point in the completely wrong direction. I still
manage to not get lost and make it through.

In Treviso I pass through an underpass that is some sort of street art gallery.

After Treviso the route follows along the Fiume Sile (river Sile).

Soon a get to point where I have two options: either the shorter direct route to
Mestre or going around the lagoon and approaching from the South via boat. The
first options goes along the Fiume Sile for a longer stretch which is supposed
to be quite pretty, but ultimately much of it seems to go through residential
areas. The second option seems to, at least later, go through a bit more of
nature. It might also be quite nice to go along the lagoon and get a first
glimpse of Venice from the boat. I'm also making good progress today and thus
I decide for the longer, second option.

Nevertheless, the first stretch of this options still goes through some
residential area at first where I'm just looking at covering the distance
quickly. But then I get back to the Piave (which I followed out of the
mountains) where it is quite nice again. On some shady benches, close to the
river, I have a lunch break. Ernest Hemingway was wounded in this region in the
First Wold War and there is a memorial nearby.

After the break I pass over a somewhat unusual bridge based on pontoons.

The cycle path along the river is interrupted by passing through San Donà di
Piave.

Then I continue along the Piave with some more interesting bridges, one
basically consisting out of boats.

I haven't seen many other cyclists today, but tucked away in a corner I pass some
sort of beer garden with many cyclists.

Now I approach the lagoon and pass a lookout.

The route now turns back West towards Venice and goes between the lagoon and the
river Sile (somehow the other river of earlier today, not sure if that river is
still in its natural river bed).

I have another break and shortly before I leave a large group of at least three
dozen cyclists passes me. Those are probably from that beer garden earlier. Now
I have to overtake all of them again.

Eventually Venice appears in the distance. The route then follows
around the edge of the tongue of land to the Southern terminus of the route, the
lighthouse of Punta Sabbioni. The closer I get, the stronger my headwinds get as
if nature does not want this cycling tour to end.

After I made it to the lighthouse I take a few steps with my feet in the
Adriatic Sea. The flat water at the beach is warmer than expected.

Then I have to backtrack a little bit. Now I have the wind in my back and I can
ride 30km/h without effort. A first boat (the waterbus) takes me to the Lido.
There I have to cycle one kilometer North to the car ferry because the waterbus
won't take my bicycle any further (bicycles are prohibited in most of Venice,
even just pushing one through the streets). That ferry brings me through the
Canale della Gudecca to the cruise ship terminal of Venice and I can enjoy the
first views of the city.

From the cruise ship terminal I ride over the bridge connecting Venice with the
main land. There I have to pass through the industrial park of Marghera. Not
necessarily the most beautiful scenery, but pretty much no traffic at this hour
which makes cycling through it at least relaxed.

I then make it to the cheap, but perfectly sufficient, hotel I booked. Cycling
through the industrial park, I was fearing that it might be so cheap because it
is located in a bad neighborhood, but it is actually in a nice and perfectly
safe residential area. After the check in and a shower, I get pizza at a nearby
delivery place for dinner. Despite being a delivery place I cannot complain
about the quality. I suppose finding bad pizza in Italy would require some
actual effort.

Today I cycled 122km in 6:18h which makes it the longest day distance-wise in
this vacation. With the flat terrain I made an average speed of 19.3km/h and
reached a maximum speed of 33.3km/h.

This concludes the cycling tour part of the vacation. The next few days I will
spend exploring Venice. In total, I cycled 667.8km up to this point in the
vacation. Despite my initial worries and slightly wet first days, I had an
amazing experience. Passing through the mountains is an exceptional experience
with grandiose views that cannot really be captured in photographs. The part in
South Tyrol was definitely the best with perfect weather (dry and not too warm),
great landscapes, mostly car free cycle paths and excellent signage. Going
through the Dolomites was also very enjoyable. I enjoyed the stretch after
leaving the Alps until hitting the Piave again a bit less. After the Alps it
just wasn't as impressive and much more of it was on normal roads (even though
mostly with little traffic). I'm wondering a bit why there are so many parts
under construction in the Italian part. Are the Italians just that slow with the
construction or are things just constantly in need of repair? (There wasn't
a single detour in Germany or Austria.) Nevertheless, I still enjoyed that part
too. Overall I might do a similar trip again in the future.
