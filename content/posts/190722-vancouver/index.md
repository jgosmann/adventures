It is my last day of the trip and I decided to visit the Museum of Vancouver to
learn a bit more about the history of the city. The museum tells the story of
Vancouver from the First Nations through the 19th and 20th century and is quite
interesting.

Besides the main exhibition there is also an exhibition on wildlife in the city
and some temporary exhibits. Unfortunately, I do not have the time for either of
these. But I still have time for a good look at the neon sign exhibition.
Apparently, there used to be quite many neon signs in Vancouver. It must have
felt quite different at that time and the exhibition gives a little bit of
a feel of that time.

After spending half of my day in the museum, it is time for me to pick up my
luggage from the hostel and head to the airport. The flight ends up slightly
delayed, but I do not care much as it is a direct flight back to Munich. Ten
hours and a few non-remarkable movies later I am back in Munich.

All in all it was a great vacation with a lot of variety: relaxing, hiking,
climbing, sightseeing. I am also glad that I was able to meet up with a number
of friends from abroad.
