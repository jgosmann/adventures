Shortly before 6am, I meet Fabian and Kristina at the Munich central station,
where we take the train to Benediktbeuren. From there we have to walk quite
a bit through the village and then on some gravel roads before we hit a smaller
trail shortly before the Tutzinger Hütte (a mountain hut).

From there we get a good view of the Benediktenwand (“wall of Benedict”).
There are a number of rock climbing routes going through the wall and we spot
some climbers. But we're just hiking today and continue our ascent via Western
ascent.

We soon make it to the summit of the Benediktenwand (1800m), where we have
a first break and enjoy the view.

We then continue along the ridge line across the Achselköpfe. <Link

in snowy conditions.</Link>

After the Achselköpfe, we reach the Latschenkopf (1712m) and have another break.

Then we continue all the to the end of the ridge line, marked by the summit of
the Brauneck (1555m). Instead of taking the direct descent to our final
destination Lenggries, we backtrack a little bit and then descent North of the
ridge line on a path that is quite a bit overgrown and with almost no one on
it. It is always surprising that even close to the cable car (at the Brauneck),
bringing many people up the mountain, you can find such quiet spots if you just
look a little bit off the beaten path.

Eventually, we reach a gravel road again and circle back around to Lenggries. To
get to the train station, we have to cross the river Isar. Near the bridge is
a spot, where we can put our feet into the cool water after this long hike
before our train back to Munich departs. It has been a hot day with above 30°C
in the valleys (luckily, a bit, but not much, cooler on elevation).

We hiked about 30km with about 1700m of elevation gain. Without breaks it took
us about 8 hours and all breaks included about 9:15h.
