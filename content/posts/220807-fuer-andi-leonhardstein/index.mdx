Today, Fabian and I want to climb the multi-pitch route Für Andi (“For Andi“,
in memoriam of Andi Hirschvogel) at the Leonhardstein (1449m). It could be
reached by public transport, but there is only a single bus late at 6:20pm for
the return trip. So we decided to take our bicycles and ride from Tegernsee.

<GpxTrack src="20220807.gpx" />

The route mostly follows the Munich-Venice cycling route. However, not the <Link
to="https://adventures.jgosmann.de/posts/220506-muenchen-venedig-day-1/">West
variant that I did earlier this year</Link>, but the East variant. It is quite
nice, going through some forest and along a small river (the Weißach). Taking
the bicycles has also the advantage that we can do the major part of the
approach with them, even though the road gets quite steep with a lot of gravel
on it at the end. For the last part we have to push our bikes.

Eventually (after about 1:30h), we have to leave the gravel road and turn into
a small footpath. This is were we lock up the bikes and walk the last part to
the wall (about 20 minutes, 80m of elevation).

I get to lead the first pitch, a <Grade system="UIAA" value="5+" />. The first
small overhang on the picture is no problem and protected by bolt. After that
follows a ledge, and then the next bolt is quite high up with an exposed spot to
climb over. I would like to have some better protection and try to place a nut
in a crack. Unfortunately, the crack isn't great and indeed the nut comes out
just as a climb above it. Thus, I get back down and try once more. This time,
I see a spot were I can actually place a sling that is unlikely to come loose by
itself because it is slotted into a crack about as narrow has the sling is
thick. Just to be sure, I also place another (my biggest) nut into the
not-so-great crack which seems to be much more solid than the previous one. This
gives me enough confidence to pass the exposed spot to the next bolt, but also
a lot of rope drag.

The rest of the long 58m pitch is also not protected in excess with one more
bolt and a few slings in rock tunnels, but I feel confident enough to make it
through the remaining subjectively still somewhat spicy climbing.

The second pitch (lead by Fabian) is quite easily done before it is time for me
to lead the third pitch. It starts with a spicy <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6-" /> crux and continues with easier slab climbing to an anchor below
a tree.

Fabian leads the fourth pitch with a <Grade system="UIAA" value="6" /> crux,
that I find to be quite fun as follower. There is also a second <Grade
system="UIAA" value="6-" /> crux a bit later that I find harder and quite
reachy. I actually weigh the rope on my first attempt. In the second attempt,
I manage the reach by using a drop-knee that turns into some sort of a knee-bar
behind flake.

Now we traverse on a ledge before Fabian leads another <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6" /> pitch. Or at least half of it as the rope drag is getting too much
again and we swap leads once more. I traverse a ledge. However, it goes around
a corner which would also produce to way too much rope drag. I figure, I must
be wrong and back climb, but cannot really see the correct route. After going
all the way back to Fabian and fetching the topo from him, I finally figure it
out and find the correct anchor. It is shared with a neighbouring route and
currently in use by another party. But then I realize out, the route leads back
to the corner where I was before anyways and I can just build the anchor there
without waiting for the other party. Ideally this would have been suggested by
the topo in the first place, as it could have saved us quite some time.

The next pitch is just a short <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" /> spot and then
walking terrain.

It is up to me to do the final pitch. There is a <Grade system="UIAA" value="6"
/> variant, but I decide for the official and better protected <Grade
system="UIAA" value="7-/7" /> variant up a slabby and blank arête. It requires
some commitment and communication with Fabian to find the exact spot to go from
the right side of the arête around to the left side, which I cannot see anymore
once I start climbing the right side. After the crux some more interesting
climbing follows, but also extreme rope drag. Nevertheless, we make it up (after
about 5:30h in the wall), have a break on the summit and enjoy the view. The fog
finally lifted a bit and we can actually see into the valley. But thanks to
the cloudy sky, it was not too hot in the South facing wall and there weren't
too many (just a few) other climbing groups around.

Then we walk back to our bicycles and can enjoy rolling downhill. A really nice
reward! Getting back to Tegernsee takes us less than an hour.

<ElevationProfile src="descent.gpx" />

The cycling part of 40km (back and forth) took up about 2:20h with an average
speed of 17.1km/h and a maximum speed of 44.8km/h. We ascended about 325m
climbing, in total (climbing, walking, cycling) we ascended and later descended
about 870m.
