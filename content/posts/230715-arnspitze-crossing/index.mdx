Fabian and I are attempting to cross the Arnspitze from Leutasch to Mittenwald.
Given the length of the tour and public transport connections, we decided to
already come to Leutasch yesterday evening. We found a reasonably cheap hostel,
the “Weißes Rössl” (“white horse”), where we stayed for night. It is actually
a quite nice place and we spent a relaxed evening on the balcony.

At 5am we quietly leave the dormitory, have some quiet breakfast, and
start the hike shortly before 6am. While there are no glaciers today, we still
want an early start due to the expected length of the tour and to use some of
the colder hours of the day. Today is forecast to be the warmest day of the year
so far, with temperatures above 30°C, in Munich even up to 36°C. At least on the
ridge line at about 2000m we can expect it to be a bit less warm, but still
quite sunny.

After a short stretch through Leutasch, the ascent onto the ridge line starts.
It is very steep and we already sweat quite a bit, even though we're not even in
the sun yet. As we get onto the ridge line, the trees give way to mountain pines
and we get some first great views of the mountains in the golden morning sun
light. To the West we have the Wetterstein mountains, and to the East the
Karwendel mountains. Both well-known and beautiful mountain ranges.

After about 2:30h, we reach the first of the Arnspitze summits, the
Arnplattenspitze or Hintere Arnspitze (2171m). (We already passed a few smaller,
minor summits like the Zwirchkopf up to here.).

Despite the amazing view, we only have a short break because the hardest part is
still ahead of us. The actual climbing starts now. From the summit, we have to
descend a slab graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />. This slap contributes
to the name of the Arnplattenspitze as “Platte” is the German word for slab. The
slab is pretty striking even from a distance. As we approach the down climb, we
spot two chamois standing below and quickly disappearing out of our sight.
Conveniently, we also find quite fresh and convenient markings leading the way.
This is unexpected; the guides where saying that there are only few and faded
markings are to be found. Following the markings and not having to guess the
best path down, it is a breeze getting down to the ridge line in-between the
Arnplattenspitze and Mittlere Arnspitze (“middle Arn peak”).

On the ridge line we have to wrestle through some mountain pines until we reach
the base of the Mittlere Arnspitze (2091m).

At the Mittlere Arnspitze we have two options. Either go around it on the
Northen side, or climb across it. It would be the hardest part of the ridge line
graded at <Grade system="UIAA" value="3-" />. Given that the route is very well
marked, we don't debate this long and tackle it head on. We find one or two, not
even exposed, spots where a move might warrant the <Grade system="UIAA"
value="3-" /> grading, but overall it seems quite easy to us. Soon, about 45
minutes after leaving the Arnplattenspitze, we are on the summit.

To get down from the Mittlere Arnspitze we have to backtrack a tiny bit, then
follow a ledge and downclimb through a groove.

Before us opens up the view to the Große Arnspitze and the remaining ridge line
leading to it.

But before that the “vicious-looking ledge“ (“bösartig aussehendes Bandl” in
German) awaits us where we have to traverse on friction foot holds, but good,
though slightly polished, handholds across an exposed spot.

A little bit more, but easier climbing follows on the remaining ridge line to
the Große Arnspitze.

Four hours into the tour (excluding the two short breaks so far) we make it to
the summit of the Große Arnspitze (2196m). This marks the end of the climbing.
Here we also meet a few more people. Before, we only saw one person that came the
other way.

Now that we have finished the critical part pretty quickly, we can take a longer
break and really enjoy the view. There are quite a few mountains and tours that
I did before visible from here, such as the <Link

To descend, we go down to the East, pass by the Arnspitzehütte, a tiny mountain
cabin, and then get back onto the extended ridge line a bit lower past the
Achterköpfe. As we get lower, the temperature rises and we get less cooling
wind. At least we get back into forest eventually, where we walk mostly in the
shade until we reach Mittenwald.

After about seven hours (excluding breaks), we arrive in Mittenwald. That is
quite a bit faster than we expected. The guide book was giving a time of 8:30h
for a bit shorter route and if skipping the Mittlere Arnspitze. Of course, the
good trail markings saved us a lot of time that we might have otherwise spent
searching for the best path. In total we ascended 1600m and descended 1700m of
elevation today.

In Mittenwald, I have just enough time to buy an isotonic sports drink as
I emptied the last of my water a few meters before. It is quite
refreshing in the heat! Then we take the bus to Garmisch-Patenkirchen and from
there the train back to Munich.
