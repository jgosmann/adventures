This weekend my parents visited me in Munich. With museums being not much fun
due to the distancing rules and need to wear masks, we decided to do the
Hausbachfall via ferrata (C) in Reit im Winkl.

The first part of the via ferrata turns out to require quite a bit of
technical foot work. Either stepping on small ledges (the right kind of shoes
definitely help) or just using the friction by pressing the feet against the
wall and pulling with your arms. We also need to look out for some polished rock.
Crossing some wooden planks with the
fixed cables being too low to be comfortable and having to pull over a slight
overhang are the more memorable parts of this via ferrata.

The second part after the rope bridge gets a bit easier. Though, there are some
wet slippery parts.

For its grade (some consider it to be harder than its nominal grade) the via
ferrata was a lot of fun. Before our bus and train back to Munich depart, we
still have some time to spend in the village of Reit im Winkl.
