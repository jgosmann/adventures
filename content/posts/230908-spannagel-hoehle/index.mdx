For today we booked a cave trekking tour in the Spannagel cave. We have to take
a gondola up and walk a few meters to the cave.

After our guide arrives, we have to first put on overalls, harnesses,
and helmets with headlamps.

Then our guide takes us deeper and deeper into the
cave while explaining interesting facts about the geology and scientific
research being done in the cave. Parts of the cave are like a via ferrata
(therefore the harnesses) or long ladders. As you can imagine, it also gets quite
narrow in some parts and more than once we have crawl flat on our bellies
through passages.

Unfortunately, taking photos from inside the cave isn't allowed.

After more than three hours, we emerge back to the surface covered in dirt. Good
thing we had overalls, but the shoes, of course, weren't protected.
