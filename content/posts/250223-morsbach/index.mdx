Climate change is real. Still little snow in the Alps and temperatures above
15°C on Saturday, prompted another climbing session in Morsbach. Untfortunately,
no one had time on Saturday, thus, I ended up going this Sunday with Antoine.
But the weather looks much worse. Instead of sun, we get grey clouds and
temperatures are supposed to barely reach 10°C.

But as we approach the crag, we are surprised to be by far not the only ones.
And more people keep pouring in after us. Though, most of them keep to the right
side of crag where the hard routes of <Grade system="UIAA" value="9" /> and
above are. So apparently they are hard-core climbers that don't care about cold,
consider cold the best sending conditions, or just have the experience when
climbing conditions are actually good. Because when we get on our first warm-up,
it turns out that the conditions weren't even half-bad. Yes, the rock was cool
and the fingers were getting a bit cold, but not so much that you'd lose the
feeling are thought they'd fall off. This was definitely better than on the
warm-up routes <Link to="/posts/250125-morsbach/">about a month ago</Link>.

After one more warm-up, we get onto Shebel Sheik <Grade system="UIAA" value="7"
/>, my "project" from last time. The first go already goes a bit better, but
I still have to rest in the rope at the crux. Luckily, I find some improved
beta, skipping some moves on really bad crimps that take way too much energy, and
instead directly going dynamically for the good hold past the crux. This turns
out to be quite possible, utilizing the right foot hold. On my second go, I send
the route. While working this route, it even got unexpectedly a bit sunny and
temperatures became really comfortable.

Besides climbing some more nice routes, I try Po-Ebene <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7" />. It starts with a hard boulder on some crimps that take all my
length to reach from the ground. While I make some progress figuring out the
first moves, I couldn't even get to clip the first draw. A problem for another
time.

As the weather is turning worse again, even a few tiny drops of rain falling (no
enough to get anything wet), and it has gotten late in the afternoon, we head
home after climbing day better than the weather made use believe in the morning.
