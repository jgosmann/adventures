Since yesterday, I am staying with my parents in Bad Ischl. We are planning to
do several via ferratas in the next eight days. Today, the weather forecast looks
good and we want to do the Intersport via ferrata going up to the Großer
Donnerkogel (2050m).

<Loc latlong={[47.52428, 13.48138]} />

After a bus ride, with an Austrian driver who is one of a kind, we change to the
cable car that brings us up to 1600m elevation. From there, it is just
a short walk (20 minutes) to the start of the via ferrata.

Usually you cannot get lost on a via ferrata because you just follow the steel
cable. However, in this via ferrata, me and my mum took the wrong turn following
the cable onto a small side summit, but ultimately a dead end. My father was
a bit behind and then took the correct way which was a few meters of walking
without a fixed rope. I even checked the topo where it branched off, but the
topo did not show any branch and thus I assumed following the rope would be
correct. In the end we had to climb back the short, but fun, detour.

We then reach the highlight of the via ferrata: a 40 meter long, swaying,
vertigo-inducing ladder.

After the ladder, we follow the ridge line up to the summit.

After a break, we make our way on a hiking trail back to the cable car. I am
in front and end up taking a wrong turn. The path was definitely taken by
other people before, but as I start to have to duck beneath mountain pines and
cannot find any trail markings anymore, I realize that I must be wrong and
backtrack. I then overtake my parents from behind to their surprise as they did
not even notice that I had left the correct trail.

We ascended (and descended) about 750m today. We spent about 3:20h in the via
ferrata and 1:30h on the descent.
