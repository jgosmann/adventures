This weekend I am doing an avalanche safety training course by the German Alpine
Club (DAV). Certainly useful knowledge when travelling in the mountains during
winter time.

We, that is the trainer, four other participants, and me, arrived yesterday
(Friday) morning at the Oberlandhütte, our base for the course. We spent the
first part of the day practicing the search with avalanche beacons. After lunch
we put on our snow shoes and hiked a little bit around the area learning about
various aspects to consider when judging the avalanche safety in the terrain.
In the evening, we did some theory and planned a snow shoe tour for today.

If time suffices, we want to summit the Brechhorn (2032m), cross the ridge line
to the Floch (2053m) and descent back to the Oberlandhütte. Turns out that the
slowest in our group are not as fast as hoped. Also, we lose a bunch of time duo
to regular stops where we train judging the avalanche safety. It is the lowest
avalanche warning level and there is not much snow (though a little bit more at
height and enough to use snow shoes). Thus, there is not any real danger. To
make it more interesting, however, we assume a warning level of two or moderate
danger.

In the end we make it to the top of the Duracher Kogel (1773m), a smaller
mountain that we need to cross to get to the Brechhorn. Besides enjoying the
view from there, we do another avalanche search practice. It is the first time,
I can actually try out the probe which is a quite valuable experience. We also
practice digging which is exhausting. But due to time, we decide not to
continue our tour and to descent from this earlier summit taking a slightly
different route with slopes of up to about 40° where we can practice our snow
shoeing descent techniques in steep terrain. That is quite useful
too!

After dinner, back in the hut, we plan a shorter tour for the next day. We sleep
a bit longer to evade the breakfast rush at 7:30am when everyone else starts
and have a relaxed breakfast at 8am to start our tour at 9am. After about an
hour of walking and some searching for geo caches (we have a geo cache
enthusiast in our group and the trainer himself is a geo cache fanatic), we get
to a ditch with some deeper snow where we practice avalanche search some more.
Then we change our plans again, and have coffee and hot chocolate at a nearby
“Alm” where we can sit outside in the sun, relax, and recapitulate the course
before heading back to the cars and returning to Munich.
