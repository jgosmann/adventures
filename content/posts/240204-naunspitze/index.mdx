Because of the little snow (as we discovered <Link
to="/posts/240127-breitenstein/">last weekend</Link>), we decided to forgo the
snow shoes this weekend. Instead we want to summit the Naunspitze (1633m) via
the South-West ridge line, which is climbing graded <Grade system="UIAA"
value="2+" />.

But first we have to hike up a steep, but wide, gravel trailfrom Kufstein.
A bit after the Vorderkaiserfeldenhütte, we put on our harness and crampons to
leave the official trail to get to the start of the climbing route. We have to
traverse across some snowy patches on a steep slope. This is what felt most
risky to us afterwards. The start of the route looks completely snow free and
dry. Thus, we decide to start climbing without roping up. But we leave the
crampons on. It takes a little bit to get used to climbing with crampons on
rock, but it is good training for mixed terrain that one might encounter on real
alpine tours where you cannot put the crampons on and take them off
again constantly.

The climbing route goes right along the edge where the cliff drops steeply off;
presenting us with some great views and a feeling of exposure.

Sadly, the enjoyable climbing is quite short. Without using the rope we're also
quite efficient and thus we are on the summit in no time (about 3 hours after we
started in Kufstein).

After our lunch break, we decide do also summit the Petersköpfl (1745m). Here we
actually have to ascent across some decent snow coverage. Luckily, the snow is
packed enough that we rarely sink in. At least for the ascent. On the way down
it happens more often, but at least it is not as tiring.

We descend the same way that we came up. Back down in Kufstein the temperature
climbed up to incredible 14°C. In total our hike took us 5:45h
(without lunch break) and we covered an elevation difference of about 1400m.
