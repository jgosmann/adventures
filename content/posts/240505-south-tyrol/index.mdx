After a great breakfast, where we were even allowed to pack something for lunch,
we hit the road for the drive back to Munich. But near Franzensfeste we want to
take a break to climb a few routes.

Getting to the crag turned out to be a bit of a disaster. We scanned a QR code
in the guide book to have Google Maps navigate us to the parking spot. For some
reason, it sends us way past the crag and wants us to turn around adding about
20 to 30 minutes to the drive. As we get to the parking spot, we realize why:
Google Maps interpreted the location to be on the highway lane we are on now, so
we had to turn around to be driving in the correct direction. But of course, we
cannot park here and get out of the car. Thus, we have to continue to the next
(luckily close-by) exit and turn around once more, but staying on the street and
not getting back onto the highway. Then we park at Franzensfeste, pull out our
backpacks and realize that we'd need to walk a bit along the street, not even
far, but without any space for pedestrians. So we get back into the car and
drive to the actual parking spot that turns out to be quite small and almost
full. Getting the car parked there takes a while. Incidentally, I came past this
spot on <Link to="/posts/220508-muenchen-venedig-day-3/">my bicycle tour to
Venice in 2022</Link>.

But then we can finally walk to the crag that is also quite crowded. It feels
more like an outdoor gym than a climbing crag. We only climb three routes. The
route Vai-col-liscio turns out a bit hard for the grade <Grade system="french"
value="6b" /> with few and tiny crimps on steep slabs. Both Alex and I fall on
the first try and don't have time for a second try. Though, I think with knowing
the beta, it could have gone down.

The remaining drive back is uneventful. It is sad that the trip got cut so short
and some of us could only get two days of climbing out of it. But for me it was
still very enjoyable. The climbing in Stuls was amazing, and also the crack
routes in the Tisner Auen were memorable for me. Having a well equipped kitchen
and cooking together was also quite fun. Hopefully, we get the chance to get
back together some other time this year.
