After three days of climbing, we take a rest day and sleep in. After the late
breakfast, I go to refill some water bottles with fresh water. The tap water
on Kalymnos is not potable and tastes quite salty. But there are stations around
the island where you can get fresh water for free. On the way, I browse through
some of the climbing stores and buy post cards.

The remainder of the morning we try to stream the IFSC bouldering finals from
Salt Lake City, but the stream is geo-blocked in Europe. I have a VPN that would
allow to circumwent it and while it works on my phone, it somehow does not on
the computer we wanted to watch the finals on. Eventually we give up, and settle
on the previous day's semifinal that can be accessed without the VPN. In
parallel, we prepare a greek salad for lunch.

In the afternoon, we walk to an Italian ice cream place and have some beach
time. We end the day by joining a drop-in Yoga class and having dinner at the
Mediterranean place Prego, where I have some delicious pasta with eggplant sauce
and goat cheese spread.
