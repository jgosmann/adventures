Today we sleep in even though it is not a rest day. We want to go once more to
Arginonta valley and in the morning it is still in the sun. But eventually we
pick up Jonas and Anja from a caf√© where they had breakfast and go to the crag.

During the first two warm up climbs, dark clouds gather above the cliff. A few
droplets of water come down, but nothing to be concerned about. Also, the
forecast showed clearly no rain for today. Then it suddenly starts to actually
rain! Quickly the wall is completely wet and everyone is scrambling to get their
stuff together and protected from the rain as best as possible. A few of us duck
under an olive tree that gives at least some protection. Finally, it pays off
that I was carrying a rain jacket with me all these days.

After ten or fifteen minutes, the rain gets less and stops. The walls dry
surprisingly quickly and my project Massive Attack <Grade value="7c"
system="french" />, which is in the so called
Rock'n'Roll cave, was protected from the rain anyways. I decide to get back on
it now. The first go, where I have to put up the draws, I still have some
trouble and need to remember all the details of the beta. I also find some more
good holds in the upper part that should help a bit with the final overhanging
bulge.

In the second go, I climb pretty fluently through the initial boulder. It ends
with a physical dynamic move to a sidepull. So far I couldn't stick it when
coming out of the boulder, but this time I can. Now a one gets a rest to recover
a little bit before climbing on some crimps to a better rest. After taking my
time and thinking that I have recovered enough, I climb into the final bulge and
throw for the finish jug, but don't quite reach it and get a less good hold
below. I try to bump up from there to the finish jug. Still doesn't work. I try
again and fail again. I'm getting increasingly pumped. I don't want to fail at
the last move. I don't know if I have the energy to do the initial boulder once
more. With my last strength I downclimb from the bulge back into the rest
position and take another rest. Breath. Breath. Breath some more. And then
breath and rest some more. Really be sure to be rested enough. The next attempt
needs to succeed. After an eternity, well, three minutes, I give it another try.
I climb into the bulge, throw for the finish jug, getting the less good hold
below again, try to bump and get my hand onto the finish jug, but not quite into
it. Only now I notice that it is actually a somewhat narrow slot that the hand
has to go into. I try to wiggle my hand more into it and succeed. I can finally
support my weight on that jug, take off my left hand and clip the anchor. This
concludes my hardest outdoor sent! Sort of, cleaning the route was still some
effort given the overhang. The video shows the initial boulder to the rest spot.

For the remainder of the day, I do some easier, but also nice routes.
I especially enjoyed Refixius <Grade value="6a+" system="french" />, though
I found it to be harder than Hippocrates <Grade value="6b" system="french" />.
Another enjoyable and densely bolted route (19 bolts!) was Alani <Grade
value="6a+" system="french" />.

We have dinner at Prego. I was in the mood for Pizza and the one at the
neighbouring table looked good. But unfortunately it wasn't the best choice and
quite cheesy again.
