Having recovered after the rest day, we are back to climbing. We decided for the Afternoon
sector which is a bit farther than Poets, but still a walkable distance. On the
way, we pick up some food for the day at a grocery store. In particular, we
restock on delicious homemade energy bars that they sell there.

At the crag, we meet Susi and JÃ¶rg again, but also one of the infamous goats.
Luckily, this particular one was mostly interested in the plants growing there,
but tried at least once to get to the tasty food in some other climber's
backpack.

Jana's Kitchen <Grade value="6b" system="french" /> is a route that I particularly
enjoy today. It has some fun and unique moves, but not every one liked it.
Unfortunately, I missed the onsight because it wasn't quite obvious to me
whether one had to go left or right around a protrusion just before the finish.
I decided for left, but unfortunately right would have been better.

To finish off the day, we go to Grande Grotta right next door. It is a giant
cave and poster child of the island. There I try DNA <Grade value="7a"
french="system" />, which is also a well-known route for the area. It is quite
overhanging all the way. I find it quite tiring and had to take many rests in
the rope to make it to the top. I guess I would have to train some more
endurance to actually send it. But it is great to set yourself in scene for some
cool photo.

In the meantime, the others have fun on the somewhat misogynistically named
route Happy Girlfriend <Grade value="5c+" system="french" />, that I also do
afterwards. It has a slabby start and turns then into a mellow introduction to
tufa climbing.

We pass the remaining afternoon with some drinks in a beach bar before having
dinner at Kokkinides. I order the classic feta cheese with honey as an
appetizer and Mediterranean pasta.
