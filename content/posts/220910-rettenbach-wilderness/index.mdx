Even though the weather still looks friendly in the morning, more rain has to be
expected soon. Thus, we spend the morning visiting the Kaiservilla (Imperial
villa, the Emporer's summer residence). The gift shop sells rubber ducks dressed
like the Emporer and Empress that we have as decoration in the bath room of our
holiday flat.

When we leave, it is indeed raining, but it stops after lunch and gets
surprisingly friendly. Thus, we decide to do an easy hike through the Rettenbach
wilderness to the Hoisnradalm.

At the Hoisnradalm, we have something to drink. The whole ceiling is decorated
with beer coasters. The female restroom is also quite extensively decorated.

The hike took us about 3:30h and had an elevation difference of 520m.
