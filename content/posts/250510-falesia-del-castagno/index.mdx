It is our last day in Finale Ligure. Thus, we decide to split up so that
everyone has the chance to work a bit more on their project. It isn't quite
ideal to do this on the last day and I would have preferred to have visited
a crag with a project a couple of times, but well. Marco and I go to Falesia del
Castagno, the rest of us visits Avancorpo di Boragni.

As we arrive at the crag, we realize that it is Saturday and thus it is really
full. The routes we were intending to climb are all occupied. Another reason why
today isn't ideal to work on projects. Anyway, we move to the right part that
I haven't climbed in the last time we were here. The easiest route here is
Anakin e Pad <Grade system="french" value="6b" />, which must serve as a warm-up.
Even though it feels a bit stiff, I manage the onsight. Then we try Donne <Grade
system="french" value="6c" /> following a nice layback crack. It isn't that
hard, except for the last move to a hidden hold. It takes me three tries to
send.

Now at least the beautiful Il ricordo di fil <Grade system="french" value="6a"
/> is free. While I already climbed it, it is worth a repeat and it is Marco's
first time on it.

Then, I finally get a try on my project Galactic Mantra <Grade system="french"
value="7a+" />. I need to remember parts of the beta again and find slightly
better beta for the beginning (where my crux is). Once I'm back down, it starts
raining. So we pack up and head out to the climbing caf√©, where we parked, to
get some drinks. In the meantime, the rain stops and we decide to go back to
the rock. It turns out to be a good decision as it is already dry again (except for
some pockets), but almost everyone else left. This gives Marco a chance to climb
the classic Stardust <Grade system="french" value="6b" /> and I get two more
tries on Galactic Mantra. On the last try, I have the first two draws
pre-clipped. This helps with the mental aspect and I can climb through that
starting crux without fear of falling badly. This leaves me much more confident
for the rest of the route and I almost make it through the second crux more than
halfway up. I fall just one move before the good jug and shortly before a really
good rest position. Unfortunately, I would need at least one or two more
sessions to send the route cleanly, but for today it is too late.

We drive home with the plan to shower before dinner, but then realize that the
other party has the keys to our vacation home. Thus, we go for a short swim in
the sea to feel at least a bit refreshed, before meeting up with the others in
Finale for a last pizza dinner. Tomorrow we will drive back to Munich.
