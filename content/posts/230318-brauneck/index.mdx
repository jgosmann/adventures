Given pretty warm temperatures and a sunny day, Fabian and I decided to go
rock climbing at the Brauneck. We skip the cable car and do the approach by
foot. It takes quite a while because we have to ascent about 700 to 800m. In
addition, there is still quite a bit of snow on the trail. Actually, for the
most part we are climbing up a ski slope. Quite exerting with all the climbing
gear on our backs! At least we do not get run over by any skiers, though we get
hit by some snow from a skier taking a sharp turn.

At the summit station, we get a great view of the Alps. Surprisingly and despite
all the snow, our feet didn't get wet so far. I am only wearing
approach shoes which are not even water proof. I did not really account for that
much snow after the <Link to="/posts/230312-brunschkopf/">last weekend</Link>.
Of course, much of it on the ski slope is artificial. At one or two spots I start
sliding downwards, but that is good training to get into the right position to
arrest yourself in such a situation. Unfortunately, the last bit of the ascend
takes us through deeper snow and our shoes are quickly soaked.

At least the rock is nice and warm with its south-facing, sunny exposure. We
start with a few easy routes around <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" /> and <Grade
system="UIAA" value="5" /> at the Gamskopf. Sadly, I am troubled by golfer's
elbow and cannot (or at least should not) climb anything too hard.

We tick our way through the routes and eventually get to "Laminator Deluxe"
(<Grade system="UIAA" value="6" />). Fabian tries first, but his foot slips in
the final overhang, spinning him around and sending him into a gnarly fall.
Luckily, he took away only a few scratches on his hand. I also took a away
a minor scratch as I hit the side of my knee on rock catching the fall.

After a short break to calm the nerves, I try my luck. I stay mentally focused
and flash the route. It tops out onto summit itself, directly at the chamois
sculpture, which is quite cool. From here I also get a good view around and see
more paragliders in the sky than ever before.

We then walk over to the main wall behind the Stie alp. This takes us again
through some deep snow. But whatever, it's not like our shoes have dried in the
meantime. There we do two more easy routes.

The sun is disappearing behind the rock wall now. Time to hike back down as it
is getting colder. This part turns out to be great fun as we get down the ski
slopes quite quickly with a mixture of running and sliding.
