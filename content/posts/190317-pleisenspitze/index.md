We wake up between 7 and 7:30am, shortly before the breakfast. Because there is
no running water, we cannot wash anyways and just need to change into our day
hiking cloths before heading down in the dining room. A typical German (and/or
Austrian as we are in Austria) breakfast is served consisting of bread with
sweet spreads (such as Nutella, jam, honey), sliced cheese, and sliced cold
meat.

Once we are finished with the breakfast, we put on our boots and snow shoes and
continue the steep ascend of the Pleisenspitze. Today the slopes get even
steeper and with the heavy snow shoes on the feet, the heavier than usual
backpack on the back (because it is a two day trip), and the somewhat thinner
air at the higher elevation, it gets really tiring. Nevertheless, we notice that
it is easier to go up straight instead of following the serpentines of the
alpine skiers. The path of the skiers tends to be slightly to narrow to walk
comfortably with the snow shoes and the slope to the sides awkwardly tilts the
snow shoes. Whereas, we can make full use of the heel lift if we go straight up.

At some point a (police?) helicoptor flies across the mountain range and gives us
quite a show, zig-zagging around the mountains and at one point getting sort of
close to use.

We have a quick snack, take in the view, and then head back down. We do not want
to stay too long because the sun is slowly melting the snow, which might
increase the danger of avalanches. While the snow during the ascent had a hard,
icy crust, it is now much more mushy and moist.

When we get to a patch of snow free grass, we take another break to eat some
more, enjoy the view, and the sun.

At the Isar we take another break in the sun before catching our train back to
Munich from Scharnitz. Today, we hiked 13.7km with an ascend of about 810 meters
and a descent of about 1570 meters

All in all it was great weekend trip with a cozy evening in a mountain cabin. It
was interesting to observe how the quality of the snow changes through out the
season (much more snow crusts than powder compared to the first hikes), but also
during the day.

Given the sun and elevation, I was aware to better use sunscreen. But I did not
consider that the snow is reflecting a lot of UV rays towards part of the body
that usually are not as affected by the sun. So I got a little bit sunburned in
those spots, but I learned my lesson for next time (I hope).
