This morning, my tire finally has not lost any air. So I only need to lubricate
my chain and can start cycling towards Toblach in amazing weather. In Toblach
I will turn South again to get over the Cimabanche pass which will be the
highest point in the vacation. The views start out pretty amazing and get even
better as I approach the pass.

At the Lake Toblach, I randomly meet the two women from the first evening. We
chat a little bit about the experiences of the last days and figure out that we
will take the same train from Venice back to Munich. We might run into each other
again then.

The normal route along the lake is closed due to construction and we debate
whether we can get through anyways or if we should try to follow the signs of
the detour. Behind the barricade is one of these cyclist counting stations
saying that 7 cyclists went through there today. Anyways, I decide to follow the
detour and leave the two women behind. I have to make more distance today and
they are busy trying to get some dirt removed from under one of their bike's
fenders that is rubbing against the tire.

At first the detour is fine, but then the signs disappear and the gravel road
turns into more of a pebble road that is really hard to ride. Luckily I make it
back to the official route shortly after. It looks like that part is still
officially closed, but there are some other cyclists on it and it is in much
better condition, so I continue there.

Close to the highest point of the mountain pass, I come along a lookout to the
Drei Zinnen, three distinctive mountain peaks with a lot of rock climbing
history.

The construction closure at the Lake Toblach was not the only one along the way.
There where a few more, but now I hit one of the more difficult ones to
navigate. While going around the underpass and crossing the road avoids some of
it, I have to dismount and push my bike for a short stretch.

Then I make it to the pass Cimabanche, at an elevation of 1530m. The highest
point of my trip. From here it will go mostly downhill down to sea level.

I am now in the Dolomites and the route follows the Dolomites cycle route which
is again following an old train connection. Occasionally, it is quite windy and
now that I have to do less work going downhill, I have to put on an additional
sweater. The views are still incredible and it is easy riding going down.

In Pieve de Cadore, I miss my turn to Venice, but I can take the next one to get
back on route. This is also were I see the first sign towards Venice (Venezia).
194km, I'm getting closer!

<Rimg src="57.jpeg" alt="Sign to Venice." />

After Pieve di Cadore, follows a traffic-free road of switch backs bringing me
down about 300 meters. Going West the wind happens to be so strong here, that
I almost wonder if it will push me back up the mountain. But it doesn't and the
other half of the switch backs going East I get down really fast. Great fun and
amazing views! The landscape starts to change quite a bit now. The mountains
become less rugged and much more lush. Signs of a warmer climate.

Besides the amazing views of the valley, I pass through some old villages that
look like they have seen better times. They are pretty much ghost towns with
a bit of an eerie feel to it. Though, in one of these villages is a freshly
renovated building that seems to be used as tourist accommodation, potentially
for cyclists like me.

On the last stretch before Longarone, today's destination, the cycle route is
closed due damage from bad weather in 2018. It was supposed to be reopened in
2021, but obviously it was not. Thus, I have to take a quite busy road instead.
For the first part this is fine because there is also a construction site and it
is stop and go traffic anyways. But after that the experience is not nice. Some
passing cars pull back to the right side way too early because the left lane is
blocked (clearly visible too). Also, one truck with trailer overtakes me and
turns right as I'm approaching an intersection (and wanted to go straight
through), bringing me into the blind angle. That is scary!

Having survived that, I make it to the bed and breakfast for tonight. The hosts
do not speak much English, but somehow we manage to communicate. After a shower,
I stroll through Longarone. It isn't a big city and definitely not a tourist
city. So the options for dinner are limited and I end up in a pub. The waitress
is young and does speak English which makes communication much easier.

Today I cycled 106km in 6:24h which gives an average speed of 16.5km/h. My
maximum speed was 51.4km/h.
