Finally it is time again for a vacation. Antoine, Anna, Anja, Jonas, Alex,
Steffi, their little baby Vincent, and I have a climbing trip to South Tyrol
planned. Split across two cars we start the drive South. Soon the Alps
appear on the horizon and the anticipation grows.

The drive is pretty uneventful. The highway across the Brenner is congested, but
we circumvent this by taking the old road. We also have to cross the Jaufenpass
with a long, and windy road that brings us up to 2000 meters and a small snow
storm before going down again. In St Leonhard, we stop with our car to buy
groceries for the next few days.

From there it is not much longer to our somewhat remote holiday home, the
Krustnerhaus. Despite leaving Munich about an hour apart, we arrive with both
cars at exactly the same time. Perfect timing!

The holiday home is a few hundred years old, but renovated and has been modified
several times. It has now several comfy nooks. The bathrooms are very modern and
smell of stone pine wood. The doorways are quite low and one has to be careful
to not hit their head; something that happens eventually to pretty much everyone
from our group. We seem to be the first group staying in this house this year
and it is quite cold this first evening, but will warm up to a nice temperature
over the next 48 hours. Surprisingly, the kitchen is very well equipped with
lots of pots of varying sizes, knives, dishes, and cutlery. We make quite some
use of it the next few days.

After settling in a bit, Anna, Antoine, and I decide to go for a walk to check
out the nearby Sefnarwand climbing crag to get some exercise after sitting in
a car most of the day (well, about 4 hours).

It turns out to be quite the adventure. To get to the wall we have to ascend
a very steep (about 45° I'd say) grassy slope. So this is not a crag suitable to
go to with a small baby. It also looks quite wet after today's rain and might
take a while to dry.

After we return, [Spätzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle) with
a lentil sauce await us for dinner. The rest of the evening is spent upstairs in
one of the nooks with chocolate, crisps, and blankets. There are some also some
quite old books around. Jonas looks through some articles about mountain sport
injuries from a hundred years ago. There is also a travel guide from 100 years
ago with some interesting description of the proper clothing.
