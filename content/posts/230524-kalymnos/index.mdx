This morning we hike up to the Poets crag. Around noon it gets too sunny and we
walk back down. We pass by the Italian ice cream place where we have ice cream
and salad for lunch.

Then, we drive once more to the Summertime crag (except Anna who wanted to relax
the remainder of the day). There I try Mama Nota <Grade value="7a"
system="french" />, but cannot get past the crux and take multiple falls. In the
end, I give up and Jonas completes the route (but rests once in the rope).

Afterwards, I do Mr. Rigolo <Grade value="6b+" system="french" />. It has good,
juggy holds and quite fun moves, but there is a large bulge where you cannot see
any of the next holds once your are under it and must know where to go.

This evening we enjoy greek food. I have [Moussaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moussaka).
