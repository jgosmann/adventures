I picked a sunny and quite warm Sunday for the first tour of the year. Fabian
and I want to do the Southern ridge line of the Taubenstein (1692m) <Link
to="/posts/221127-taubenstein">once more</Link>. But right now I am standing at
the S-Bahn station and wondering why the displays say it is 563
minutes until the next train departs. I know that the trains aren't on the
regular schedule because some construction (seemingly this happens always when
I want to take the S-Bahn), but online it said that at least one train
should be coming in 10 minutes. Only after I check in the app, I realize that it
departs on different track than usual.

So I still make to the central station where I meet up with Fabian to take the
train to the Schliersee and then the bus to the Spitzingsattel. During the ride
we see a beautiful sunrise with the sun slowly creeping above the mountains in
the distance with the orange light being scattered in the frost on the leafless
trees.

The first few meters of the ascent we have some snow, but soon the trail enters
forest and all remains of the snow are icy patches. We have to be careful to not
slip. After we leave the forest, we finally get enough snow to put on the snow
shoes. Though, it isn't as much snow as two years ago in November (where we
dearly missed the snow shoes).

Eventually we make it to the ridge line. We've planned on climbing it with
crampons and securing ourselves with a rope. But with the exposition to the
South, we find it completely free of snow and ice. Thus, we decide to keep that
stuff in our backpacks and do the climb free solo. It is a quite enjoyable climb
in the sun. The difficulty is graded at <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />, but
only two spots of it actually reach that difficulty (and truth to be told I'm
not sure where the second spot of those is supposed to be).

On the summit, we have an extended break. Despite some wind, it is warm enough
that I don't even pull out my down jacket. The view is quite good. Towards the
South we can even see some mountains in the Zillertal like the <Link
to="/posts/230814-gigalitz">Gigalitz</Link> and <Link
to="/posts/240909-schwarzenstein">Schwarzenstein</Link> that we have been on
before. Towards the Northeast we see around a dozen or more hot-air balloons
around the Wendelstein.

We descend via the Taubensteinhaus to Geitau. Shortly before Geitau we have
another break on a sunny bench because we still have quite some time to spare
until the next train. It feels like a spring day. The tour was rather relaxed
with only about 600m of ascent and 1000m of descent. Without breaks we were
moving for only about 3:30h.
