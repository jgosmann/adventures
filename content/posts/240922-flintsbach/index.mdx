After a week of rainy, cold fall weather, we have a nice, sunny, and warm, but
not hot weekend. Ideal climbing conditions that Fabian and I use for day in
Flintsbach. After a supposedly <Grade system="UIAA" value="6-" /> warm up with
some spicy slab moves nonetheless, and a few more warm ups that are repeats of
previous ascents for me (but still quite nice routes), we want to take a look at
a sector I haven't been to yet.

<Loc latlong={[47.71756, 12.12464]} />

It is supposed to be all the way to the right of the crag. But there is no
obvious trail leading towards it. There are some tracks along the cliff that go
up a steep, muddy slope. Getting up there is anything but comfortable.
After a couple meters, the tracks disappear and we are not any wiser. In the
end, we turn around. It seems that none of the other climbers around know how to
get to this ominous sector. We figure that the rock there is probably mostly wet
anyway because it is in the forest and even in the other sectors many routes
are wet. So we stay at the known sectors.

After one more moderate route, we get on Ghostsong <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7+" />. The topo descriptions mentions a hard move on crimps. This is the
first crux and Fabian does not manage to get through it. But when I try it,
I find it a lot easier than I expected for the grade and given the description.
Up high follows a second crux through a short overhang and then then route's
trademark move: a high step up onto a slab where you have to stand up one legged
and maintain balance. It takes me while to figure out the somewhat powerful, but
also technical crux. But it definitely feels doable, though I am not yet able to
link everything together on my second try. But definitely a great project that
I will come back to!

We finish off the beautiful climbing day with some relaxing easy routes.
