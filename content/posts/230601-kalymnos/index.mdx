We split up today. Jonas and Anja go to Arginonta valley again so that Anja can
sent her project. Antoine, Anna and I go to Trois Îlots once more.

We only do a few routes, not especially hard routes. Nevertheless,
Prosciutto + Champagne <Grade value="6a" system="french" /> has a nice corner.
Here is Antoine climbing it:

We finish with Pornogeros <Grade value="6b" system="french" /> (apparently the
name translates to “dirty old man”). It starts with slab climbing on small
holds, and gets progressively steeper until it ends slightly overhanging on
jugs. Here is Anna climbing the bottom slab:

Around noon, when the sun comes around, we hike back down, have some leftovers
from yesterday's dinner for lunch and get an ice cream. The afternoon is spent
with rest day activities, including some beach time. The others also go to
a climber's massage, but I decide to save my money.

We have dinner at Kokkinidis with delicious Mediterranean pasta and crepes with
icecream for dessert.
