Since my rear tire is still losing air, the first thing after the breakfast is
another attempt to patch it up. At least I can do it under a roofed area where
it is dry. I also clean my bike a bit to remove some of the mud that I collected
on yesterday's ride. This makes my start today quite late (around 10am), but
today's distance is also shorter. The two women from yesterday left about an
hour earlier.

Unfortunately, it is raining lightly again. But the Achensee (lake “Achen”) that
I soon reach is still a pretty view.

After the Achensee a steep and fast downhill ride follows. That is quite fun!
Unfortunately, that makes me lose all of yesterday's elevation gain and I will
have to climb it all up once more at the end of the day.

The downhill ride brings me into the valley of the river Inn which I follow
towards Innsbruck. At Stans (after about 30km) I take a detour, lock up my bike,
eat a bit, and do a short hike through the Wolfsklamm (“wolves' gorge”). I was
debating first whether to actually do it, but then thought, I am in the rain
either way and with the rain there is more water feeding into the gorge making
it even more impressive.

Due to Corona restrictions, only one-way traffic is allowed in the Wolfsklamm
and I have to take a slightly longer path back on a wide gravel road. I was
told, the whole round trip takes two to two and a half hours, but it took me
barely more than an hour. If I had know this before, I could have spent a bit
more time enjoying the gorge.

As I continue with my bicycle in the afternoon, the rain finally stops. Passing
through Schwaz, I look around the nice pedestrian area in the old city core.

After Schwaz, I pass a device counting the number of cyclist that have passed
this point. Along the way, I will discover a few more of these. Sometimes there
are also places that offer public tools for small repairs on a bike.

Eventually I pass a supermarket and use the chance to stock up on some food.
Not long after, I also find a nice bench at the Inn and have my first proper
break with sitting down and relaxing a bit on this vacation

The official route goes through Innsbruck, but I take an alternate option that
avoids Innsbruck for several reasons:

- I have seen Innsbruck before and it is easily reachable by train from Munich
  if I wanted to visit again.
- Going through the city, I have to expect more care traffic and it is easier to
  get lost.
- There is supposed to be a bit less traffic on the alternate route and the
  incline is supposed to be not as steep.
- My next accommodation is directly on the alternate route.

So I leave the Inn and start the climb. It is really steep and with the weight
of my luggage I am slow. Even though there was supposed to be less traffic on
this route, there is still some traffic on this big road. Unfortunately, it also
begins to rain again. At least it is a paved road and I know that it will be
soon over for today. I just need to endure a little bit longer. Halfway up
a cyclist on a racing bike overtakes me, but well, without luggage I would also
be faster. The good thing is that every bit of elevation gain today, I won't
have to climb up tomorrow.

Eventually, I make it to the hotel for the night. At the check-in I get a nut
liquor on the house which I think I have definitely earned with today's climb.
Apart from that, I again enjoy a nice, hot shower with my panniers that need to
be cleaned again. For dinner, I eat from the food that I bought earlier in the
supermarket. There are no restaurants super close by and I do not feel like
riding my bicycle somewhere to eat after this day and given the still somewhat
wet weather.

Today's distance was a bit shorter with 76.1km in 4:12h to regain some energy
for tomorrow where it is going over the Brenner, the first mountain pass on this
tour. My maximum speed was 47.1km/h and I made an average of 18km/h.
