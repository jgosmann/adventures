Now that I'm in Berchtesgaden, the vacation is almost over. After the long day
yesterday, I have a very relaxed start before I cycle the last few kilometers to
the Königssee on a nice path along the Königsseer Ache, a small stream. Then I'm
suddenly spit out at the touristy shore of the Köngissee. This is the end of my
journey. I lock up my bicycle, and walk a few minutes to the Malerwinkel
(“painter's corner”) with a very nice view of the lake. A little bit farther
a find a quiet spot to take a swim, read a bit, and enjoy the tranquility of the
scenery.

A bit past noon, I walk back, grab something to eat, and ride back to
Berchtesgaden, where I catch a train back to Munich. I timed it well as a couple
of minutes after my departure we ride through rain. I'm quite lucky to not have
had any rain day the whole week.

Today, I only cycled 17.1km, which took me about one hour. Still I achieved a top
speed of 59.3km/h going down the hill on which the youth hostel was located.

I found the route of this cycling trip a bit more demanding than my <Link
to="">Munich-Venezia</Link>. Maybe it is because I had additional luggage due to
the camping equipment, but maybe also because instead of two long ascents, it
was a lot more up and down. Also, I had more headwinds and it was quite warm.
Nevertheless it was quite enjoyable with beautiful landscape, even though less
varied than on the Munich-Venezia route, and great downhill rides.
