We have record temperatures for early April in Southern Germany this weekend. We
use this for a weekend get-away in Schleching. Today, we are climbing at the
Klobenstein.

<Loc latlong={[47.6906, 12.3969]} />

We start with some warm-ups. My second warm up route has
a funny spot where you can basically lay down on a slanted ledge and chill out.

We then continue to go up the grades a bit. Kurz und Bünding (“short and
concise”) <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" /> is quite short with a bouldery crux
that I still manage to onsight thanks to some pre-existing chalk marks.

After Heckentrail <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />, I do an unnamed route

<Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />. It gives me more trouble with some bouldery
moves involving a crack. But after I figured out the moves on my initial go, I
can redpoint it in the second go. Like many routes in this crag, the crux is
quite low and the top part is pretty easy.

At the end of the day, I decide to try Elefantenohr (“elephant ear”) <Grade
system="UIAA" value="7-" /> as last route. I don't regret it as it has some
interesting moves in a corner and a somewhat committing second crux. I can
redpoint this route also on my second try.

We then check-in into our hotels in Schleching and have dinner at an Italian
place.
