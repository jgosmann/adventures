Martin and Kristina have to leave after breakfast because they have to drive all
the way back to Cologne today. However, Fabian, Susanne, and I still do an easy
half-day hike after saying our goodbyes. We start by visiting a gorge, the
Breitachklamm.

The Breitachklamm is a tourist hot-spot, but we are early enough for it to be
not that crowded yet. With all the rain in the previous two weeks it is quite
impressive.

After we passed the gorge, we have a short walk to a bridge, giving a view from
high up over the gorge.

Then we continue along the river, that is flowing
through the gorge, upstream on a rather wide trail and come back to our starting
point in a loop. Sadly, it is now time for us to drive back to Munich.
