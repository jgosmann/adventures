It's another weekend with summer-like weather in mid-April. Fabian and I use it for
some sport climbing at the Morsbach near Kufstein. This must be the climbing
crag that has the best connection by public transport from Munich. Surprisingly,
it isn't listed in my Munich-specific guide book. To get there it is just a ~75
Minute train ride and then about 30 minutes of walking.

Unfortunately, the crag is full-on in the sun. This is a bit unexpected because
supposedly it should have been in the shade of trees. But apparently some of
those trees in front of the crag have been cut down. At least this gives a nice
view of the Wilde Kaiser mountains.

We start with the easy start to Po-Ebene <Grade system="french" value="5c" />.
Unfortunately, I slip in the lower part and thus didn't properly send the route.
Past the start it is quite slabby.

Next, we move to the left part of the crag that actually still has some shade.
I can onsight Miraculix <Grade system="french" value="6a+" /> with a slightly
committing somewhat mantle-like move. Then we work Fingerbeißer <Grade
system="french" value="6b+" /> (“finger biter”). The name is quite accurate as
the crux is on two side-pull/undercling crimps that cut into your fingers.
Especially the undercling because you need to bring a lot of force onto it to
build up enough tension between it and your foot. It takes me quite a while to
figure out the sequence, but in my second go I can execute it flawlessly and
send the route.

Moving further left, we try Purple Love <Grade system="french" value="5b+" />,
but the bottom part is surprisingly hard and I only hangdog it (and didn't give
it another try).

After a few more routes in-between, we end with Verschneidung <Grade
system="french" value="5b"/>. It leads through a corner (Verschneidung is the
German word for corner) and has super nice moves. Unfortunately it is also super
polished and quite slippery in many spots.
