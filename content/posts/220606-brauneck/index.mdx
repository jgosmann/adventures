I use today's public holiday to go climbing with Fabian, Vesna, and Vroni at the
Brauneck. Three of us take the gondola up, but Fabian insists on walking up
there. But at least we can take his backpack up in the Gondola. We then wait for
him with coffee (and tea) in the panorama restaurant, and he arrives right when
we are finished.

We decide to walk to the climbing sector near the Stie-Alm. After an easy warm
up, I climb a number of quite enjoyable routes around <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6-" />. The route “Le soleil est près de moi” (<Grade system="UIAA"
value="6" />) even has a little overhang.

I finish the day by climbing “Steinbrecher” <Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />.
It is a very nice 30m route going partially through a corner. Another group
tried it before us and got shutdown in that corner, but the guidebook says the
crux is higher up right before the end. So I am a bit worried how hard it might
get. Nevertheless, I manage to get through the corner part without too much
trouble. It turns out that the crux is indeed right before the end. On my first
attempt, I down climb a few moves, where I have a good rest position, to
recover, but on my second attempt I make it through the crux with some physical
effort.

Even though, it is popular climbing area, the rock has still a lot of friction
and is polished in few places. Definitely an area worth visiting another
time. It is also reachable quite well from Munich. Only the gondola ticket is
a bit pricey (or you face a 50 to 60 minute walk up).
