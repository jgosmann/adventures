We have the usual breakfast with ham and eggs. Then we pack up and leave for our
last, but long hiking day. We first circle around the Kanjavec which brings us
close but not quite to the Zasavska koča na Prehodavcih at the Northern end of
the Seven Lakes Valley, where we stayed a few days ago.

There we meet another hiker who is a bit lost. He wanted to get to Trenta, but
is walking in the wrong direction (from which you could still get down to
Trenta, but it is not the direct route). We set him back on the right track and
hope he will find his way. He seems to still miss his sense of direction.

As we already traversed the Western ridge line and part of the valley, we
traverse the Eastern ridge line today. It brings us across the summit of the
Mala Zelnarica (2320m) after about two hours of hiking.

As we descend, the landscape slowly transforms. The rugged rocks turns into more
rounded shapes, and the landscapes becomes more grassy and greener. Among
the grass we find a few more
[Edelweiß](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leontopodium_nivale).

Because it is only a minor detour and less than 100m additional elevation gain,
we ascend the Mala Tičarica (2071m), the last peak in the ridge line. We are now
close to a really popular hut, the Koča pri Triglavskih jezerih hut next to the
lakes, and it gets quite busy on the small mountain top. We have a lunch break
anyways (we have been hiking for a bit over three hours now) but do not stay for
long afterwards. Surprisingly, my altimeter shows exactly the elevation noted in
the map. Usually, it is not that precise and it has been at least a day since
I set the reference point. Seems like the weather is very stable right now.

Next, we descend half an hour to the Dvojno Jezero and that popular hut.
Luckily, it is not too busy around there and we can enjoy the idyllic scenery
for a bit. We also grab some more drinking water from the hut.

We then continue for a while without gaining or losing much elevation through
lightly forested areas. Eventually, we get to a small agglomeration of old
shepherd huts where many trails cross. Somehow we do not find the trail we
wanted to take, but end up on a trail that brings us to the Koča na Planini pri
Jezeru hut. Luckily, this is not even much of a detour for us and gives us
a chance to have a break with some nice scenery after another 2:15h of hiking.
We have stew, [Sauerkraut soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbage_soup), and
[Radlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandy#Radler) (they use the German word
in Slovenia).

As we continue, the trails are starting to get wider and easier. In another
2:15h we make it to Ribčev Laz. There we look for the bus stop that we will need
tomorrow. Then we have pizza for dinner because it is the most convenient
option, right next to where we are. On a table next to us are two women that we
recognize, they stayed the last night in the same hut. Ribčev Laz is quite busy
with mountain bikers, hikers, and other outdoor enthusiasts.

After dinner, we walk another 20 minutes along the lake to get to the hostel
where we will stay for the night. It turns out that there is also a bus stop
directly in front of the hostel. Thus, we do not even need to walk back into
town tomorrow. After check-in, we finally get the chance to take a shower
again!

This was our longest hiking day with 8:45h, 830m elevation gain, and 2336m
descent.

After a comfortable night, we enjoy the breakfast buffet. Then we take the bus
to Bled. With €1 for both of us, it is even cheaper than the bus on the first
day. In Bled we have some time to kill because we
wanted to make sure not to miss our connection. We walk down to the Blejsko
jezero/lake and relax on a bench. There happens to be a rowing regatta that
starts a while after we arrive.

At 10:50am our connecting bus departs. With two short breaks it goes directly to
Munich. It is surprisingly full and we get some of the last free seats.
Unfortunately, we get stuck in traffic and are delayed by about 100 minutes
before we are back home.

It was an enjoyable vacation. The weather was pretty good without being too hot.
Only the second day ended up a bit short due to bad weather. The hikes were
a good mix of beautiful landscapes and challenging alpine trails. Despite still
being the Alps, everything seems to be a bit wilder than in the German or Austrian
alps and thus provides a different experience.
