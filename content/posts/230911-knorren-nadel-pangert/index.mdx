We take the first gondola up to the top station near the Penken. From there it is
only a short approach to the Steinbock via ferrata at the Knorren-Nadel (2081m),
though we have to go around a construction site. There are actually two via
ferratas here that cross each other twice.

We reach the start of the easier Knorren-Nadel via ferrata (B) first. From there
it is quite the scramble to the start of the slightly more difficult Steinbock
via ferrata (C). It would have been easier to use the Knorren-Nadel via ferrata
to reach the first crossing of the two via ferratas. Later we figure out that
the two via ferratas have different approach trails, and we should have
approached from the other direction. But well, too late now. We enjoy the via
ferrata nevertheless.

After a quick descent, we continue with a hike for the rest of the day. Across
the Penken we first hike up the Wanglspitze (2420m). For a major part we have to
walk on gravel roads and there are many other people. Only the final ascent is on
a more narrow trails. There's also a lot of ski infrastructure here, that isn't
the nicest to look at. The summit is blemished with the top station of a ski
lift. But we also get some nice views.

From the Wanglspitze, we continue to the Hoarbergjoch (2590m). It is just
a notch in a ridge line and nevertheless the highest point today. The descent
from the Wanglspitze is again on a wide gravel road, but suddenly there are no
people to be seen anymore. Close to the Hoarbergjoch, the trail becomes narrow
again.

Past the Hoarbergjoch, the trail becomes much less used and is at times hard to
find. But the views and landscape are now really great. It feels even a bit
remote with no one else in sight.

Eventually we make it to our second summit, the Pangert (2550m).

The descent goes down a steep grassy slope. According to the guide book the hike
has medium difficulty, but the trail has a “hard difficulty” marking by the
alpine club. At least the guidebook acknowledges that the trail can be faint at
places and that one should use the markings to find the way. Unfortunately, the
markings are old and faded and far apart. While we still manage to stay more or
less on the trail in the steep part, we completely lose it as it flattens out.
Luckily the terrain is not that dangerous or difficult here and we make it
eventually to the gravel road that we follow for the remainder of the descent
the Grillhofalm. An alp in another valley disfigured by massive ski
infrastructure.

Now we only have get back to the gondola. The guidebook recommends to go up
a ski slope. At first it isn't quite clear which path is meant with that and of
course normal maps aren't showing ski slopes. But after some discussion we
figure it out. A little ways up we have to pass an excavator, cleaning up some
dead trees or something, and blocking the whole path. But we manage to get
around. Not much further and our path is blocked by a barbed wire fence that we
cannot get over easily. It does not look like it was very new, so I have no idea
why the guidebook recommends this path (and it isn't that old either). Anyways,
we therefore continue to go up more or less along the fence through more rugged
and strenuous terrain until we reach a spot where we can step over the fence.
A little bit later we are finally back on a proper path, well, actually gravel
road. Not much longer and we finish our hike back at the gondola.

The hike took us about six hours without breaks. We ascended 950m and descended
1100m.
