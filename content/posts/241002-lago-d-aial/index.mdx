It is raining in the morning. Thus, we have a relaxed start into the day, do some
grocery shopping and prepare a lunch. In the afternoon, the rain stops and we
set off for a small hike to the Lago d'Aial.

Surprisingly, it gets really sunny.

Along the way, we take a detour to the Grotte di Volpera. After following the
trail for a bit, we weren't quite sure where to leave the main trail, but did
find the correct point to branch off. Then the forest suddenly opens up to some
huge, impressive rocks. Being so secluded between the rocks and with all the
overgrowth, it had a bit of a mystical feeling. On the rock faces, climbing
routes have been bolted (many looking quite difficult). Between two rocks was
also a via ferrata with a slackline and rope bridge. However, it is apparently
not for public use, but requires to book a mountain guide.

After the detour, we continue to ascent, cross a river gorge, hear the grunt of
a deer, and eventually reach the Lago d'Aial.

Next, we head to the Lago di Pianozes.

Then we descent back to Cortina. We get some great views of the surrounding
mountains in the evening sun.
