We're not on the Triglav for sunrise, but still get some nice sunrise scenery at
the hut.

For breakfast, this hut offers a choice of five menus, we pick the eggs and ham
option. Then, we start our Triglav summit day with a light backpack (we will
sleep another night in the same hut). We do not take the most direct route along
the Western ridge line, but first walk around to the Eastern ridge line.

We pass the Dom Planika pod Triglavom hut, one of the other two huts below the
Triglav. It is getting supplied this morning and we see the helicopter fly back and
forth many times.

Past the hut and a field of scree, the actual Triglav ascent begins. This is the
only part where the trail markings are not quite as good and we climb off trail
for a bit. Luckily, it was still pretty solid rock and easy climbing. After
a backtracking a little bit, we reacquire the correct trail and continue our
ascent without issues. When we get to the top of the ridge line, that leads
directly to the summit, another trail merges with ours and it starts to get
really busy. We overtake a number of people, but at times also have to wait.

After about 2:30h, we are at the literal high point of this vacation, on the
highest peak of Slovenia. With its 2864m, the Triglav is quite a bit higher than
any surrounding mountain and we can see incredibly far. We can make out the
Adria and the Großglockner (the highest mountain in Austria and the East Alps)
for example.

Eventually, we start our descent via the West ridge line. It is much less busy.
The last part to the hut is the same trail we already took yesterday after
exiting the Bambergweg.

The descent took as about 1:30h, which means it is still early afternoon. Enough
time to summit another mountain after a short break at the hut: the Kanjavec
(2569m).
The ascent starts directly at the opposite side of the hut and involves quite
a bit of loose rocks and a bit of climbing. The trail markings are surprisingly
fresh and must have been redone recently. We make it up in about 45 minutes.

We descend via the South-Eastern path, which is a bit easier then the ascent,
then we circle back to the hut. This takes us about another hour. Thus, we hiked
about 6h in total today and ascended/descended about 1300m.

The hut is a bit busier this night (are we establishing a common pattern here?).
We have two new room mates, two German women. For dinner I have Carnolian
sausage with Sauerkraut again. Seems like I made it through most meals offered
traditionally on the Slovenian mountain huts. I had all five meal options,
offered here, before. This will be our last night in a mountain hut for this
vacation.
