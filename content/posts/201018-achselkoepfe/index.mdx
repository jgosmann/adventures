After our days in Füssen, the weather was a little bit rainy and we spent the
days in Munich. But the forecast for today is better again and we do another day
hike in the smaller mountains close to Munich.

After a train and bus ride to Lenggries, we take a gondola up to
slightly below the summit of the Brauneck (1555m). After a short ascent, we
follow the ridge line from the Brauneck to the Latschenkopf (1712m). The last
few days led to even more snow accumulation, but the trail has been plowed well
by a number of other hikers, though it is not very busy today (on a summer day it
probably would be).

The trail after the Latschenkopf is not plowed as well. Some people are
approaching the summit from that direction, however, and we decide to see how
far we get along that trail.

A little bit later, we make it to a saddle and we have to decide whether we want
to descent from here or continue a bit more on the ridge line along the
Achselköpfe (up to 1710m). The latter trail is difficult and we are unsure
whether we can do it with the current snow conditions. A trail runner coming
from there recommends to not do it without cleats (which we do not have), but
another group (also without cleats) passes us while we still discuss. Finally,
we decide to at least try and see how far we can get safely. In the end, we can
do the whole trail across all of the Achselköpfe.

After passing the Achselköpfe, we could continue to the Benediktenwand, but
this would be too time consuming today and we start the descend back into
the valley where the snow covered trail turns into a lot of mud before we hit
a narrow gravel road. From there we follow a few more trails through fall
colored forests back to Lenggries.

We took about six hours, ascended about 560m and descended about 1380m on this
fall hike.
