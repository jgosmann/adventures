On Friday we had this year's fall retreat at my workplace. Today is the
subsequent leisure day and together with five colleagues we will do a gravel
bike tour to and around Lake Starnberg. The route is based on <Link
to="/posts/210523-starnberger-see/">my similar tour with my normal trekking bike
a few years back</Link>.

At 8am we meet the center of Munich to pick up our rental bikes (just two
colleagues brought their own). Twenty minutes later we are on the road,
southbound along the Isar. It is a bit foggy and wafts of mist move slowly over
the river. With the colored leaves of the fall, it is a somewhat mystic
atmosphere.

After passing Grünwald, we cross the Isar, climb up the incline on the other
side with some uncomfortably close passing cars. Shortly after we're back on car
free paths through the Forstenrieder Wald.

Soon we can roll down towards Starnberg. There we stop at a café for some hot
drinks, cake and sweets. The weather is quite cold with a few degrees above
freezing and it is nice to warm up again. While I generally got pretty warm on
the hills, me feet also started to feel a bit cold.

We then continue clockwise around the lake. We are lucky and the fog starts to
lift, with the sun coming out every now and then, finally raising the
temperatures to more comfortable levels. Starting at the southern tip of the
lake we can even make out the mountains of the Alps at times.

In Tutzing, we have another break in the sun at the lake side. We decide to
split up into two groups of three. One half will enjoy the sun at the lake for
while and take the train back to Munich. While the rest, including me, continue
all the way back to Munich.

We decide for an alternate route on the way back. It follows the Würm, another
stream, after passing Starnberg for the second time. It is a quite beautiful
trail and quite fun with the gravel bike. But then we have to follow a bicycle
path along a big road for quite a while to get back to Munich. At least we are
fast on it and go around the major inclines of the route this morning.

We rode a distance of approximately 120km (my GPS tracker turned itself off for
while, so its a bit of a guess) with an average speed of 19.5km/h.
