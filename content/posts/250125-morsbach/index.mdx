Little snow in the Northern alps, sunny weather and temperatures up to 13Â°C are
forecast. Bad conditions for your usual winter activities, but excellent weather
for the first outdoor sport climbing day of the year. At least in a somewhat
South-facing crag like Morsbach.

Fabian and I don't start super early to give the temperature some time to rise
after the night. We arrive around 10:30 am at the crag and start with Via Angela

<Grade system="UIAA" value="4+" /> as warmup. It is quite good for the grade with
a small roof, but really good jugs to pull over it. We then also try the slightly
harder, direct line Via Angela direkt <Grade system="UIAA" value="5-" />.

We then move a bit to the right into the sun where temperatures are really
comfortable. There we do Schlinge <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />. It can be
started from a ledge, but we do it ground up, first climbing Nobody <Grade
system="UIAA" value="4+" /> and than seamlessly transitioning into Schlinge,
combining the climbs into one long thirty meter climb. The crux of Schlinge is
on small, rough crimps.

Our final route of the day is Shebel Sheik <Grade system="UIAA" value="7" />.
The first half is somewhere between slab and face climbing. Then it gets quite
a bit harder going through a shallow corner. The only usable hand holds are
right in the middle of the corner, a shallow crack that requires some
layback-like moves, good technique, and strength before transitioning to some
crimps with only one good hold in-between. It takes me quite a long time and
many breaks in the rope to find the holds, all the correct body positions, and
finally make it to the top. Many of the holds are also quite polished and I'm
now full on in the sun, making it quite hot (hard to believe it is a January
day). I'm sweating a lot despite not wearing much. On those glassy holdes, the
fingers start to feel slippery quickly after each chalk-up. After Fabian's
attempt, I have a second attempt that is already much better, but I still have
trouble transitioning from the crack onto the crimps. A project for next time as
the crag is now in the shade (which made the temperatures in the route much
better) and we make our way back to Munich while there is still light. The
January days are still short. Nevertheless, we get a nice view of the Kaiser
mountains in golden afternoon light.
