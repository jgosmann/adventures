A bit before noon, Fabian and I board the train to Fischen in the Allg√§u. We
will spend the next few days there with Martin and Kristina (and their baby
Jonas). We are looking quite forward to it because it has been a while since we
were in the mountains together.

After an uneventful train ride, we arrive in Fischen about 2:20h later. From
here, we walk not quite 30 minutes to our holiday flat, a bit outside of the
village in the forest with quiet surroundings. It is quite nice, even though the
kitchen is not as well equipped as it was in our holiday home in <Link

Tyrol</Link>.

Fifteen minutes after us, Martin and Kristina also arrive. After unloading, we
drive to the supermarket to shop loads for the next few days. Then we have
a short walk through the surroundings. We follow a sign to Gundelsberg. The name
ends in the German word for mountain, so we hope to summit some small hill.
We're well aware that in the 10 minutes walking time given on the sign, we won't
climb a tall mountain. But in the end, it just turns out to be the name of
village and we walk back.

Then it occurs to us that we forgot to buy strained tomatoes. So we walk to the
supermarket once more and we find some nice trails for the way back. I suppose,
some hikers coming the other way, wondered why we were carrying two glasses of
strained tomatoes in our hands on these trails (we didn't bring backpacks).

The remainder of the day is spent cooking [Chana
Masala](https://www.thecuriouschickpea.com/restaurant-style-chana-masala/)
and planning the tour for the next day.
