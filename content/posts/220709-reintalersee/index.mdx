I take the train from Munich East to Kufstein at 7:50am. I want to do the via
ferrata at the lake Reintalersee. First, I looked into getting there completely
by public transport, but the schedule of the bus for the last leg is not at all
coordinated with the train schedule. Then I though about walking that part, but
that would take me an hour along roads. So I decided to take my bicycle. I could
still have gone all the way to Kramsach by train, but it would have cost me
another €20 (whereas up to Kufstein I can get with the German €9 ticket, from
there I have to pay the Austrian prices). But it turns out, from Kufstein to the
Reintalersee it is just about 30km, or 35km on a nicer route with less traffic.
Also, the via ferrata in itself isn't that long in relation to the time that
would be spent in trains. Thus, I am cycling all the way from Kufstein.

The train ride is just about an hour and then I am on my bike and follow the Inn
valley cycling route. It is pretty flat and I have some, but not really bad
headwinds. Before Angath, the road is unfortunately closed without a signed
detour. The alternate path I follow brings me back to the closed road, but it
turns out to be fine. Even though the road was partially resurfaced, there is no
construction going on on a Saturday and one can get through without problems.

At some other point I must have missed detour signs quite a distance before the
closure, but again manage to get through the construction area.

Before the Reintalersee, I have to climb about 160m and then get a short
downhill ride. Up to here, it took me a little less than 2 hours. Now it is
about 30 minutes uphill on foot to get to the start of the via ferrata. On the
way is a waterfall that turns out pretty underwhelming despite what the
information boards promised.

At the start of the via ferrata I have to wait a bit for a family to down climb.
Apparently, they only did one other via ferrata of difficulty B before. But the
easiest variant of this ferrata is rated C/D. Good thing that the ferrata starts
right with a C/D spot and the family did decide to turn around. I am, however,
looking for a bit more of a challenge and do the E rated variant. The E-rated
stretch is sort of divided in two parts with a C spot in between that gives
a good and appreciated rest opportunity. The E rating is fair as there are few
artificial steps, the rock only has small features, and it is a bit overhanging.
My arms definitely start getting pumped, but it is important I keep a cool head
anyways and make it through without trouble.

After the E part, the C/D variant joins again and there is a bench that I use
for a welcome lunch break. Afterwards two more short C/D spots follow, but the
rest is fairly easy. Then it is about an hour of descent through the forest and
finally along the road at the lake to get back to my bicycle.

I ride the same route back to Kufstein, except that now I manage to follow the
detour for one of the construction sites. The wind must have turned. Now I have
even stronger headwinds that are noticeable a bit, but I am still pretty fast,
even a bit faster then in the morning because I know the route already.

In total I took about 6:30h to 6:45h for the tour.
