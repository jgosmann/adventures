After already being awake for while, Fabian and I get up a bit before the
planned time of 4am. Silently we sneak out of the room and get ready for today's
long tour to summit the Patteriol (3056m) via the North-East ridge line. The hut
us with packed lunches for the early breakfast.

Shortly before 5am, we leave the cabin in the light of our headlamps. After
about thirty minutes, we leave the gravel road and start the approach that we
scouted yesterday. As we get higher on the steep, overgrown slopes, dawn sets in
and we eventually have enough light to navigate the difficult terrain without
our headlamps.

At the start of the climbing route, 90 minutes in, we need a while to find the
right spot to start. Presumably, the pink spot referenced in the description is
still covered with some old snow. The first sixteen pitches are all not harder
than <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />. Given the low difficulty and the length
of the route, we simul-climb it. In case one of us falls, this is more dangerous
than doing regular belays, but also much faster. Whenever one of us runs out of
quickdraws, we switch leads.

After eleven pitches, we reach the North-East ridge line. From here, we get
great views far down the valley and towards the Konstanzer HÃ¼tte. But soon, we
are engulfed in clouds that only occasionally give way to the view below. A few
more pitches and we reach the first <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" /> pitch,
where we switch to proper belays for the remainder of the route. I lead this
pitch with a somewhat tricky start around a corner onto a slab and some spaced
out feet. It then goes through a somewhat chimney-like feature which is a bit
annoying to climb with my backpack.

The climbing two pitches after that I quite enjoy. You first move on steep
terran, but good holds, from the side of the ridge line back onto it and then go
along the thin top. Then we reach the box with route's logbook where you can put
your name into to proof that you have done it. It is followed by the <Grade
system="UIAA" value="4+" /> crux of the route that turns out quite overhanging,
though with excellent holds. Still, it could have been graded <Grade
system="UIAA" value="5" /> in my opinion.

A couple more pitches, and were on the summit at 2:20pm. We have a short break
and even get lucky that some of the clouds move away for a bit of a view. But
a tour isn't done until you're back down; and the way down isn't particularly
easy and still involves a fair bit of <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />
climbing. The first part is also not easy to find. There are some cairns, but
they are pretty hard to spot between the rocks and random scree.

Eventually we make it to a plateau covered with an old snow field, where we
loose the descent trail. But we know the rough direction and have a GPS unit
that also helps us to keep direction. After crossing the snow field, we quickly
reach an official trail that brings us back down. It is now past 5pm and less
than an hour until dinner in the cabin. I'm not sure we're gonna make it, but
once we reach the gravel road back to the cabin, we can start a brisk walk and
make it back at exactly 6pm, right in time for dinner. A great tour comes to an
end!

We were somewhat slow in the climbing part, so in total we were out for 13 hours
and covered an elevation difference of 1400m.
