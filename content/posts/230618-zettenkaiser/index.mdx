Today, Fabian and I have planned a nice ridge “walk” across the Zettenkaiser
(1968m) and Scheffauer (2111m). It is a long tour with an estimate of about 10
hours. Luckily, we have long hours of daylight in mid-June and the train ride
from Munich to our starting point in Kufstein only takes an hour. The weather is
forecast to be stable and despite pretty warm temperatures above 25°C the risk
of thunderstorms is supposedly low. In other words: ideal conditions.

From Kufstein, we hike to the Kaindlhütte (Kaindl hut) on mostly wide trails and
gravel roads. Even at 8am it is already quite warm. At the Kaindlhütte we turn
towards the Hochegg (<Link to="/posts/230129-hochegg-gamskogel/">that we stood
on in the winter</Link>), but turn left before to ascent the ridge line of
the Kaiser Mountains. There is no official or marked trail here, but there is
a clearly visible, steep trail. Carrying up a 70 meter rope here is really
strenuous. But we might need it later.

As we get higher, we get some first great views of the Inntal and Hintersteiner
Lake. Eventually we reach the ridge line and follow it. It requires some easy
climbing up to <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />. The first part we do without
belays.

When we get to some solid bolts, we take advantage of them and set up a belay.
After this first pitch, we get to the crux which has been mitigated with two
bolts and slings in them. Technically that makes it aid climbing, but the moves
are still graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />. Afterwards, it is a bit
easier again. After sixty meters or so, we join a marked trail where it is
barely climbing anymore. This spot is marked with text written on the rocks
warning that the following part is only for experienced hikers. Though, for us
it is one of the easiest parts of the ridge line.

On the summit of the Zettenkaiser, almost six hours in, we have the first major
break. Now we need to discuss whether to continue to the Scheffauer. This part
is unmarked again and rarely done. From here we need to rappel and down climb to
a notch in the ridge line and then ascent on the opposite side. Even though we
get a good view of the opposite side, it is hard to tell the exact route.
Finding the correct rappel spots is even harder. From the top we cannot get
a good view of the walls below us and we have some trouble matching the features
with the photograph taken from a completely different perspective.

While ruminating, we get joined by another group. They are committed to go on.
In the end, we decide to not continue, even though it might still be fine
time-wise. We already spent quite some time looking for the rappel spots and
even after the rappel it might take a lot of time to find the correct path up to
the Scheffauer. Instead, we take the marked trail back to the Kaindlhütte, which
requires to backtrack a bit of the way we came.

Even going down the marked trails involves some climbing and there are some
uncomfortable spots with loose rocks. Fabian is a little bit ahead to avoid
being in the path of rocks that I might inadvertently kick down. Because the
path leads with many bends through mountain pines, I cannot see him at all
times. After a while, I notice, that he wasn't in sight for quite some time and
I am starting to wonder whether he is that much faster. But as there was no fork
in the trail I continue. I start to get a little bit worried. Maybe I have
passed him somehow? Or there was a fork? But I come to the conclusion that the
only reasonable thing is to continue to descent. The Kaindlhütte would be
a logical meeting place. Almost there I still cannot see him, but I have some
cell phone reception. I try to call him. It takes a second try for the call to
get actually through and only half of the speech is transmitted. But it is
sufficient to verify that I do not have to call in a mountain rescue, that he is
behind me, and that we will meet at the Kaindlhütte.

Not knowing how long I will have to wait, I order a wheat beer at the hut. Also,
I do not have a lot of water left and need to hydrate some more given the hot
weather. Shortly, after Fabian appears. He also orders a wheat beer and tells me
that he came off the path. When he got back to the path he must have been behind
me.

Refreshed from the beers, we descent back to Kufstein. We are delighted to find
water fountain with potable water on the town square where we can refill our
empty water bottles. On the ridge line with the wind it was not as noticeable,
but it was quite hot today. I even have a visible salty crust on some parts of my
face. Despite not doing the full planned tour it was still a quite long tour
that took us about nine hours, not counting breaks. We also ascended and
descended 2000 meters of elevation.
