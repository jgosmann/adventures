The last day in Squamish. Because we have been climbing for 9 days without
a rest day, the skin on my fingers and my feet hurt. Thus, I take it easy today.
Also, Tim's family comes to visit him and to try some climbing themselves. We
head to the Smoke Bluffs which are essentially within the city of Squamish.

There I try to climb High Boltage Line (5.10a). It has a high first bolt (get
the name?), but the first moves are fairly easy within a crack system. However, to
reach the bolt you have to step to the right onto slab and that seemed too risky.
Also, I was not sure whether to do that in a lower or higher spot. Both
options seemed potentially viable, but neither seemed safe enough. So I bailed
and downclimbed.

Next we set up a top rope on Foot in the Gravy (5.10d), a short slab climb with
a shallow corner (and only two bolts, with the first one high up again). While
I was able to hangdog my way up, it was really hard with many insecure positions
on tiny crystals. No idea how people lead that at all.

For the rest of the day I followed or toproped trad climbs set up by Tim and
Christine such as Dusty Eyes (5.4), The Alexis Cracks (5.7), and Libya Sucks
(5.7). It was fun to do some laybacking, hand jamming, and foot jamming in those
cracks. Those are moves you rarely get on sport climbs.

We end early (the last 9 days of climbing are taking their toll), get showers,
eat Sushi, and pack as we are leaving tomorrow.
