This night wasn't quite as wet as the previous one, but there is still some
light rain in the morning. Thus, we have again a relaxed breakfast. Around 9am,
we leave for our ascent of the Berliner Spitze (also known as Dritte Hornspitze,
3254m).

Along the trail, we see some chamois. Only a short bit later, a rock starts
falling near us, hits the slope that makes it shatter and bounce off. Luckily,
we are not hit, but a bit startled. Maybe a chamois kicked it down? We decide to
put on our helmets and continue. Gladly, we don't experience any other rockfall
today.

Around noon, we reach the edge of the glacier at about 2900 meters of elevation.
At first, we are a bit indecisive whether we should continue, but in the end we
decide to turn around. There is no hard factor forcing us to turn around.
However, several factors aren't quite ideal. There is a lot of rocks on the
glacier, hinting at regular rock fall, the weather hasn't improved, and the
clouds could make orientation difficult, especially if they get thicker, and
neither of us has done this tour before (in contrast to yesterday, where Fabian
has been on the Schwarzenstein before).

After having lunch, we start to descend back down. When we are already quite low
again, we get caught in a light rain shower. But soon we are back at the hut and
can dry our stuff.
