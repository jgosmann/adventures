Last year I cycled from Munich to Venice. On the first day, <Link
to="/posts/220506-muenchen-venedig-day-1/">I chose the West variant along the
river Isar</Link> to the Austrian border. But I always was curious about the
East variant. Today the weather is much better than on the first day back then
and I am finally trying the East variant.

<GpxTrack src="20230917.gpx" />

The first part is identical to the West variant and follows the Isar for a bit. But
soon, I leave the Isar and ride through the Bavarian landscape, often besides
railway tracks on surprisingly long straight sections. Here I can go fast
without much stopping. Though, some parts are only gravel roads with some
unpleasant regular bumps. Soon the mountains are in sight and seem already much
closer than I would have expected.

So far the path was pretty flat with a constant, but not really noticeable,
incline. Now, a bit before the lake Tegernsee, it gets a bit more hilly. It is
a nice downhill ride towards the lake. There I have a lunch break.
Unfortunately, there is a half-marathon that day and I have to take a few
detours (but the cars have to wait in much longer lines).

While the ride so far was nice, I liked the East variant more so far. But after
leaving the villages around the Tegernsee, going South towards the Austrian
border, it is really beautiful. It is well worth it, despite knowing a segment
of that part already because of
a <Link to="/posts/220807-fuer-andi-leonhardstein/">bike and climb day out to the
Leonhardstein last year</Link>.

At the Austrian border, I continue the Munich-Venice East variant back up to
Lenggries. I pass along the Walchenklamm with some more nice views. But the
paths are pretty rugged, littered with pebbles. Of course I knew that from <Link
to="/posts/220506-muenchen-venedig-day-1/">last year</Link>, but I'm happy that
I do not have to ride them in the rain again.

Unfortunately, the rough path is too much for my back tire and all the air in it
is gone. At least this time I got farther than barely out of Munich before this
happened. I fix two double punctures and cannot find another one. But after
continuing my ride, I'm still losing air pressure. I try again to find another
puncture, but without success. Unfortunately, I do not have a bowl with me (or
enough water left for that matter), which would make the search much easier.
I also have no spare tire. Thus, I have to pump the tire up to the best of my
availability with the tiny pump that I packed, and repeat the process a couple
of times for the final stretch of 20km. At least it is pretty much downhill from
here and the rough gravel roads are also soon left behind as I pass the
Sylvenstein water reservoir.

After 125km I make it to Lenggries. Near the train station I still find a place
to buy a wheat beer to quench the thirst. My water and food are pretty much
gone. Back in Munich, I still have another 6.5km to get back home from the train
station. Conveniently, there is a public bicycle air pump located halfway with
only a minor detour. It is much better than the small one that I have with me
and is sufficient to get enough air pressure to bring me all the way home.

Today's tour took me (excluding breaks) about 6:50h which makes an average speed
of 19.1km/h. This is a bit slower than planned for, given the flat tire.
I reached a maximum speed of 48.3km/h.
