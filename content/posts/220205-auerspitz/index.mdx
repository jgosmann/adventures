Some new snow in the last week, a few snow-less days for the avalanche risk
to go down, and sunny weather promise an excellent day for snow shoeing in the
Alps. Fabian and I plan to ascent the Auerspitz (1811m) from Bayrischzell.

<Loc latlong={[47.64376, 11.94528]} />

The first part takes us through a wintery valley until the actual ascent starts.
Initially it can be done well without snow shoes.

Later the snow gets deeper and very powdery. We don't want to destroy the ski
trails, but that means we have plow our own trail. It is fun in the powder, but
also quite strenuous.

Eventually, we follow a valley in-between two ridge lines
before circling around and ascending the Auerspitz summit on the left at the end
of the valley.

After taking a break and enjoying the view (the Großglockner and Großvenediger
are visible), we start our descent to Geitau. At a lake (though it is frozen
with snow on top and thus not really visible), we bask in the warm sun before we
enter the shadow of another ridge line.

Unfortunately, we just miss a train back to Munich and have to wait 40 minutes
for the train in the opposite direction. It is just a couple of stops until the
terminal station before it goes back to Munich and thus can be in the warmth
already 20 minutes earlier than waiting for the train going in the "right"
direction.

The hike took us (with breaks) about 7:20h. We ascended about 1160m and descended
about 1190m.
