The prevailing inversion weather situation (where warmer air is layered
on colder air in the valleys) had to be used for a snow shoe hike. Already the
train ride down to Garmisch-Partenkirchen gave quite beautiful views of the
Bavarian winter landscapes, though still cloudy and foggy. But close to the
destination in clears up for a day of blue skies and sunshine.

After a short walk through the city, I begin my ascent. At one point I miss the
small snow-covered path that I wanted to take. So I have to walk a little bit
back and find some faint tracks with the help from my GPS device. Apart from
that, I have no wayfinding troubles.

As the ascent is on the south-facing side, the snow cover is thin and it makes
no sense to use snow shoes. Nevertheless, I get some great views of the wintery
Garmisch-Partenkirchen and surrounding mountains like the <Link

After 2:40h, I reach the summit of the Wank (1749m). I have a lunch break and
enjoy the views even more. Though, once I have eaten, I quickly pack up because
the wind is becoming a bit cold. I descend to the North and snow shoes are
finally helpful.

Eventually, I take a left turn and then take a small path, the Hüttlsteig, back
to close the loop. I'm the only person on it. Most other people probably take
the much wider trail below; especially the ski tourers who would not be able to
take the narrow Hüttlsteig with their long skis. But in general, it wasn't busy at
all in the area.

Once I close the loop, the way back to Garmisch-Partenkirchen is pretty much the
first part in reverse; except that I skip the hard to find path and walk a wider
path. I had to rush a bit to catch my train with three minutes to spare.
Otherwise, I would have had to wait a whole hour for the next train.

On the way back, I could enjoy the winter landscapes once more in the light of
the setting sun. In the lower parts, ground fog was forming and gave it a bit of
mystical impression.

The 15km hike took me about 6:10h (4:20h walking, about 0:30h lunch break, about
1:20h standing around elsewhere). The elevation difference was about 1150m.
