It is my last day in Vienna. In the morning, I take a stroll through the gardens
of the Belvedere Palace. It is a bit higher in elevation than the city center
and gives a nice view.

After enjoying the Gardens and killing some time this way, I make my way to the
Sigmund Freud museum. I'm a bit early and have to wait a few minutes before it
opens at 10am. It is also interesting with a lot of information about the life
of the founder of psychoanalysis. The museum is in his actual living quarters
and his practice, though almost none of the original furniture has survived.

The museum has the right size to finish until noon. This gives me enough time to
make my way back to the central station and grab some lunch before my train
back to Munich departs.
