Finally, the weather improves again, and we can do another hike. We ascent
a nicely exposed path along a cliff to the Gleckstein cabin (2316m). On the way
up we have to be a bit careful as the rock is still wet in many places.

Half-way, we pass the station of an old gondala from around 1900. It sits right
at the cliff-edge and overlooks the valley, but hasn't been in use since the
First World War.

Not much farther, and we are surprised by the path going behind a waterfall.
Time to get out the rain gear to get not fully soaked.

At the cabin after 2:20h, we have
[Rösti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6sti) and Chäshörnli (somewhat similar
to Mac'n'Cheese) served with apple sauce. With new energy, we descend on the
same way that we came up. While we didn't meet anyone on the way up, we now pass
several people still on the way up. The weather has even gotten somewhat sunny
and the rock is now mostly dry.

In total, the hike took us 4:45h with 888m of ascent and 1200m descent.
