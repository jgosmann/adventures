Another beautiful and sunny day that Fabian and I use to ascent the Hochmiesing
(1883m). It is close to the Auerspitz <Link to="/posts/220205-auerspitz/">where
we were a month earlier</Link>

<Loc latlong={[47.65784, 11.94141]} />

For most of the ascent below the Hochmiesing's South face, the snow is packed
enough that we do not need our snow shoes. Just for the last 200m of altitude
gain they become useful.

At the summit we enjoy the warm sun for close to an hour. Actually, I will later
have a light sunburn on the top of my head (at the beginning of March!).

We descend on the North side of the Hochmiesing back to Geitau. Excluding the
break it took us about 5:15h in total, with about 1100m of ascent and descent.
