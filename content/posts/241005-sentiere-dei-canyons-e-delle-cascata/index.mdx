Finally, the weather has improved, so we can finally do the via ferratas
Sentiero dei Canyons e delle Cascate Fanes (B). We take the bus to Podestagno.
From there we have to hike for a bit. Once more, we take a wrong turn, but the
path also brings us to where we want to go.

After an hour, we get to an impressive viewpoint across the deep, narrow gorge.
Here, we get ready for the first via ferrata. It starts harmless, but not long
and we have to pass behind a waterfall, where we get soaking wet.

Now, we are in the upper part of the gorge, and have to get down a little bit,
crossing a small stream twice, climbing down some boulders, and another short
via ferrata on a wet slab.

After a final crossing of the stream, we follow another easy (and much drier)
via ferrata back to our starting point. We took about an hour for the via
ferratas.

Now we continue hiking upwards, first through the upper part of the gorge and
later along a stream.

Fifty minutes later, we reach the final waterfall with another via ferrata.

Again, this via ferrata leads behind the waterfall.

A bit disappointingly, the via ferrata was quite short and took us only 20
minutes. But we get another nice view from the exit. From here we take 1:40h to
hike back down. Instead of Podestagno, we head to Fiames where slightly more
buses are departing. Nevertheless, we have to wait for a while. We ascended 500m
of elevation and descended 650m today. Our highest point was at 1760 meters.

This was our last day in Cortina. Tomorrow, we will depart in the early morning.
First with the bus to Toblach, then a first train to Franzensfeste, and from
there with a second train back to Munich (and my parents with another train to
Hannover). The dolomite mountains bid farewell with pretty Enrosadira, the
reddish glow of the mountain tops in the morning sun.
