Just two weeks after the last alpine tour and a COVID-19 infection in-between,
I'm starting for the next alpine tour. Hopefully, my lungs weren't affected too
much and I can still handle the altitude. This time, I am joined by Beatrice and
Christian who I met at the <Link to="/posts/210818-alpine-tours-course/">alpine
tours course last year</Link>. Originally, we were hoping to have a reunion of
all members. But unfortunately only us three could make it in the end.

Today, we drive from Munich to Hopffeldboden and then hike up to the Kürsinger
Hütte (hut) at 2558m, which will be our base.

Unfortunately, it is raining lightly. It is warm enough, so that we do not put
on our rain gear. We would be sweating a lot under it. We follow the mountain
river Obersulzbach through its valley. The first part is a long gravel road, but
at times quite steep. There would have been the option to take a shuttle
service, but we did not reserve it and thus are stuck with walking through the
rain.

After about two hours, we reach a alp where stop inside for a drink and
[strudel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strudel). They also have a drying room
where we can store our backpacks in the meantime. They get them surprisingly dry
before we head out again. Having dried off a bit, we decide to put on our rain
jackets now. We have cooled off a bit and as we are slowly gaining altitude, the
temperature is also dropping.

After about another hour, we reach the shuttle drop off where the road ends in
a narrow trail. It soon gets quite steep as we need to ascend the last 600m
of elevation to the hut. It seems that COVID didn't have too much of a long
lasting effect as I'm always a bit faster than the other two despite having an
additional 2.7kg of load because I am carrying the rope.

Finally, after about 4:30h and 1500m of elevation we reach the Kürsinger Hütte
in the fog.

We check in, have dinner (soup, chicken curry, apple sauce), and discuss the
next day. There is a notice posted in the hut that there is acute danger of
falling into crevasses on the glacier. It makes us slightly worried. According
to the weather forecast, tomorrow is going to be better conditions (less chance
of rain and thunderstorm) than the day after tomorrow. Thus, it will be our
summit day. Nevertheless, an early start is imperative and we agree to wake up
at 4:30am to leave by 5:30am. Thus, we prepare our packs for the next day
and go to sleep. We have three bunks (or mattresses) in a room of eight
right under the roof. To get there we have to cross through one of the larger
rooms with communal bunks. It is partially occupied by the army that spread
their belongings all over the place giving a somewhat chaotic impression.
