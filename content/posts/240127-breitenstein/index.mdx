Fabian and I start today's hike from Geitau. We first ascent the Kirchwand
(1478m). The summit cross looks especially nice with the frost on its mossy
parts and the attached fir twig.

We then continue with a summit of the neighboring Schweinsberg (1514m). It is
a slight detour that we have to walk back afterwards. Finally, we hike up our
main target for today, the Breitenstein (1622m).

There is not much snow coverage, so carrying around our snow shoes is pretty
useless. Cleats would have been good as there are some icy patches, and the
remaining snow is frozen pretty hard. It's almost impossible to even kick in
steps with the shoes. But nevertheless we make it safely up and back down.

After descending, we circle back to Geitau. In total, it took us about five
hours including a 20 to 30 minute lunch break. We covered an elevation
difference of 1190m.
