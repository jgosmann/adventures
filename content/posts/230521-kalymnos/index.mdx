Today we are at the fairly new Griffig crag. It is in the shade almost all day.
Susi connected us to Susi and JÃ¶rg whom we meet there.

After a few warm up climbs, I try and onsight Pestalozzi <Grade value="6c"
system="french" />. It was apparently the second most-ticked route in 2022 on
the climbing website 8a.nu. The reason is probably that the grade given by the
original bolters of the crag was <Grade value="7a" system="french" />. But this
was apparently a joke because Pestalozzi was a Swiss philanthropist,
so the route is quite easy for the grade.

Also some other routes are easier than their grade suggests. Thus, I try 0,07 seconds

<Grade value="7b+" system="french" />. It has a hard dyno at the entry and is
supposed to be easier afterwards. However, as I finally manage to get a hand on
the target hold, but slide off, I get a cut in my middle finger and decide to
not try again. Nevertheless, I still redpoint Millionenbach <Grade
  value="7a"
  system="french"
/> which makes me also quite happy.

To finish off the day I do the 40m long route Griffig goes to Kalymnos <Grade
value="6b" system="french" />. It is quite enjoyable climbing, though being
tired from the previous climbs, it turns out to be a bit of a fight.
