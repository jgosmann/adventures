After several days of climbing (for most of us), we decided to have a rest day
at the beach today. After a snack in a beach bar, we go for a swim in the sea.
It is a bit annoying that most parts of the beach are private. But at least the
water is not as cold as the Lake Garda a couple days ago. Because the first of
May is a public holiday in Italy, the area around the beach is quite busy.

Later we eat an ice cream trying out a different, but also excellent place, in
Finale Ligure. The remainder of the day we chill at home and cook some pasta
for dinner.
