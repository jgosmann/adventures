Slowly something like normality is returning to Germany and Austria. The
climbing gyms have reopened, albeit some restrictions are in place, and climbers are venturing
into the outdoors again. So it happened that a group of four, including me
and my colleague Andreas from the company I work for, drove to the Martinswand
(“Martin's wall”) in Austria near Innsbruck on this beautiful Sunday.

There we split up into teams of two to tackle different multipitch climbs.
Andreas and me decide to do the six pitch route Flying
Grass <Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />. I get to lead the first pitch, immediately
starting with a committing slab graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />.

Unfortunately, I have some trouble finding the anchor at the end of the first
pitch. There should be two bolts for an anchor, but only one is to be found. I consider
adding the second pitch that happens to be a very short traverse for which
the ropes would definitely be long enough. However, I should be able to see the
anchor of that pitch already, but all I see there are single bolts too. So I improvise
a bit and use the climbing rope itself to setup up a redundant anchor using the first bolt of the next pitch as second anchor bolt. Luckily, the terrain
is easy enough to climb up and down to and from that bolt. While belaying my partner
up I can already enjoy a nice view despite not being that high up yet.

Andreas gets then a very short and easy second pitch (<Grade system="UIAA" value="5-" />). It turns out it actually
has two anchor bolts. I just could not see one of them hidden behind a tuft of
grass.

I'm back to leading the third pitch (<Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" />), which
happens to be the crux pitch. Supposedly. It starts with quite an overhang
right off the anchor, but it has good grips and being well rested from switching
leads at the anchor it poses no problem at all. After the overhang some more
fun slab climbing awaits.

The fourth pitch (led by Andreas again) is supposed to be a mere <Grade system="UIAA" value="5+" />,
at the start even a lowly <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />. It turns out to be
much harder face climbing with thin holds. It is possible that we accidentally
climbed a pitch from a neighbouring route, but cannot say for sure. It is also
unclear where the actual route would have been.

Anyways, at the next anchor we reckon that it cannot get any worse because
even if we are at the neighbouring route (which we definitely weren't for the
next pitches as we learn later), the difficulty is not graded any higher for
what is ahead than what is behind us. Thus, I start the next pitch (<Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />)
confidently, but it turns out to have a lengthy crux with hard to spot holds
and a somewhat weird final crux move. In the end I pump out and cannot climb
this pitch clean.

Andreas climbs the last pitch (<Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />) which turns out to be a breeze.
At the top of the climb we eat our packed lunches and discuss the next plans.
We wanted to do another multipitch starting above this first one. Unfortunately,
the first climb took us longer than expected and we figure that we do not have
enough time left. We decide to descent and do a few more sport routes in a
different section of the wall.

I try Der 3. Mann (“The Third Man”, <Grade system="UIAA" value="7" />) because it looks quite interesting.
The first part is an easy crack, starting out as a slight off-width and narrowing down.
Than the upper part gets super interesting. Part of the wall is set back with a
thin crack were the set back wall joins the protruding wall. There aren't any holds
on the wall of either side of crack and the wall is slightly slabby.
It climbs unlike anything I have climbed before. Unfortunately, the rock has
gotten glassy and super slippery in many spots and I take a few attempts in
most spots. In the end I cannot make it to the top and rappel down. Nevertheless,
it was a great learning experience.

The protruding rock on the route casts a shadow on the holds, but the rest of
the wall is in direct sun light and we quickly notice that the wall is way too
hot to climb anything remotely hard. Thus, we only do one more easy route, Fritzchen <Grade system="UIAA" value="4-" />.

On the trip back, we stop in the small Austrian village of Rattenberg to have
dinner and something to drink. Because we did not want to carry that much heavy
water on the multipitch routes, we did not bring much and got quite thirsty.
