On Thursday I end work a bit early and take the train to Untergrainau.
The Waxenstein is glowing in the evening sunlight in anticipation of the big
tour tomorrow: summiting the Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain at 2962m, in a single
day via the Höllental.
But first I check into a hotel room, spend the remaining evening on the balcony
above a little stream with some ducks swimming around, and go to bed early.

After the night, I leave the hotel at around 6am. First, I have to walk about
20 minutes through Untergrainau to get to the actual start of the hike.
Whe Waxenstein is now glowing in the morning sunlight instead.
The calves, on a meadow I pass, are already quite awake.

At the start of the hike one would usually follow the Hammersbach as we also
did <Link to="/posts/191003-riffelspitze">back in November when we hiked up to the Riffelspitze</Link>.
However, there is some sort of construction going on and the path is closed
(of course this was not mentioned anywhere on the Internet).
I meet a somewhat confused foreign hiker there, who does not understand much
German, and point her to the signs for the alternative trail a little bit higher
up that I also have to take now. Plan for the unplanned.

At the Höllentaleingangshütte (“Hell's valley entrance hut”), I join back onto
the planned path which is also the same we took up to the Riffelspitze. It leads
through the Höllentalklamm (“Hell's valley gorge”) which did not lose any of
its appeal the second time around. This time I forgo the rain jacket and enjoy
being sprayed by some cold water after having worked up quite a sweat already.
Despite the early hour, it is already 20°C and the thermometer will certainly
climb up to 30°C today. Luckily, it will be cooler higher up.

Then the narrow gorge starts to open up into the Höllental (“Hell's valley”).
The scenery is not quite as magical as in November with the yellow leaves and
a topping of snow, but still very impressive with imposing mountains to either
side and a streak of green in the middle

Not long after, I pass the Höllentalangerhütte (“Hut at the Hell's valley green”).
Most people spend a night there to split the 2200m ascent to the Zugspitze into
two, which leaves only 1600m for the final push. Okay, most people probably don't
even do that and take the gondola up instead. But where's the achievement in that?
Anyways, due to the Corona restriction, you currently have to bring your own sleeping bag
in the huts of the German alpine club and I rather do 600m more in one day than
schlepping a large and heavy sleeping bag 1600m up the Zugspitze.

From the Höllentalangerhütte, I get a good view of what is lying before me.
After passing the remaining flats of the Höllental, a via ferrata
(“Das Brett”, “The Board”) awaits, followed by some easy free solo climbing,
more walking, crossing a the Höllentalferner (Höllental glacier), and another
via ferrata all the way to the top of Germany.

About 2:20h in, at around 8:20am, I reach the base of “Das Brett”, the first
via ferrata of the day. Time to eat a protein bar, while enjoying the view back
over the valley. Then I put on my climbing harness and get in line with the
stream of people. There is a little bit of a traffic jam here and, while I only
occasionally passed other hikers on the first part, from now on there will
always be other people around. I assume most of them started from the
Höllentalangerhütte, but some might also come from where I have started, but left
earlier and took longer.

The via ferrata is followed by some (very) easy, unsecured climbing (<Grade system="UIAA" value="1" />).
It is not exposed at all, so a belay would really be overkill.
In the steep terrain (compared to a hiking trail), I get quite out of breath
(and the air is starting to get thinner at the altitude).
After completing the climbing part, I take a break. It is a good spot to do
so because there are still bushes and grass around and you can still see a bit
into the Höllental. Many other people also use this area for a break.

The trail through the Höllental is known for its varied landscape.
Next I cross a desert of scree which is not the nicest ground to walk
on and I have to be careful not to slip or lose my balance.
As I am getting closer to the glacier (Höllentalferner), there are spots of
ice peaking out of the scree. The summit also looks already surprisingly close.
But this is deceiving. It is still a few hours and several hundred meters to
ascend.

Right before the glacier is another popular spot for a break.
Mostly because there will no other good spots for a break until the summit.
Around quarter past 10am, I join the group of resting people and mentally prepare for the glacier.
It is my first time ever crossing a glacier and the main danger are crevasses
that you can fall into. Either because the snow cover breaks under your weight
or because you slip on the ice and slide down into one.

While this is the second largest glacier in Germany (okay, I guess we do not
have that many glaciers in total), it should be quite safe, at least today
(conditions can change). There is no thick snow cover on it that could hide
crevasses, but it is also not open, slippery ice. Moreover, there is an
established path followed by many people which should make it improbably that
some instable snow bridge collapses under my weight of all things.

Most people do not even use proper crampons, but only cleats for some additional
traction. I even see some forgoing cleats completly. Hiking poles are also a much
more common sight than proper ice picks. I borrowed crampons and an ice picks
from the German alpine club to be safe and, now, that I have carried the weight
up all this way (the crampons alone are a kilogramm), I want to use them. Also,
I can finally make use of the crampon binding on my mountain boots.

It is definitely possible to ascent the glacier without crampons in the current
conditions, but not slipping as much is more comfortable. I am also quite happy
to have a third point of contact for balance with my ice pick, though a hiking
pole might have done the job as well.

At the end of the glacier I have to get into a line again.
This is the spot of the Randkluft, the chasm that forms in-between the rock
and glacier ice when it melts away. It is the part I am most concerned about
today because you have to pass it to get onto the via ferrata on the rock face.
Apparently, people have fallen into the chasm before and slid 16 meters
deep. A cold place next to the ice while you wait for a rescue.

There are two starts to the ferrata. On the left one there is already quite a
gap, but at the right one there is still a stable ice bridge touching the rock.
It is no problem at all to transfer onto the rock there.

Another 500m of ascent to the top using the via ferrata await.
The first part of it is graded B/C and the most difficult part.
In addition, my shoes are still wet from the glacier and are thus a bit slippery
on the rock. The remaining part of the via ferrata is graded only A/B, but
the people move slowly. Eventually, a couple without any via ferrata sets passes
to my left. I realize that there is quite easy climbing terrain with lots of
space to pass and I decide to follow the couple. While I cannot quite keep up,
they are insanely fast with minimal gear (no backpacks), it allows me to skip ahead
past the traffic jam of people and gives me a pretty unhindered path to the top with
probably the best views of the day.

Eventually, I make it to the top of the ridge line revealing the view to the
other side. From here it is just a few more steps to the summit, but for the
obligatory summit photo I have to get into line once again. In about seven hours
I made it all the way to the top.

Then it is time to cross over onto the summit station of the gondala.
Here I wanted to have a celebratory drink an then take the gondola down.
But I realize that I would not really enjoy the beer in-between all these
tourists. Also, it is just quarter past 1pm. A bit early to call it a day.
So I start thinking about a crazy idea again that I did not expect to be
that realistic: not only summit the Zugspitze, but do a crossing of it,
descending back down to Ehrwald via the Stopselzieher via ferrata.

<Rimg src="43.jpeg" caption="Tourists in their natural habitat." />

How is my motivation? Still stoked, check. How is the weather looking? Despite
clouds it does not like a thunderstorm is coming up and the weather forecast
agrees, check. How tired am I?
Not that tired, check. How much time do I have until the last train back to
Munich from Ehrwald? More than seven hours, check. How long will it take me
down to there? The ascent along that route is usually cited with four to five
hours. The descent should not take any longer, check. Are there any dangers to
be aware of, especially later when I might start to get exhausted? The first
part is most critical descending a steep, but easy via ferrata (A/B), then the
terrain
flattens out and should get increasingly easier, check. Do I have enough water
and food? I still have enough food and water to get at least to a hut on the
path, check. Am I overconfident? Well, most overconfident people probably do
not think of themselves as overconfident when they make the critical decision,
but I think this should be within my abilities, check.

So I walk a little bit along the ridge line crossing into Austria (the Zugspitze
is barely even in Germany) and then take a right turn down the Stopselzieher
via ferrata. Thanks to the steel cables I can descend it quite quickly by
leaning back into the cable and stemming my feet against the rock trusting the
friction (basically laybacking in climbing terms). In-between there are repeatedly unsecured parts across loose scree
and gravel with chossy rocks. Here I have to be careful to not start sliding
uncontrollably. Going this path up does not seem enjoyable to me. The landscape
is also not as nice, though going down you get nice some views of Ehrwald and the
Eibsee.

One hour later, I reach the Wiener Neustädter hut where I finally have a
(alcohol free) wheat beer and restock my water supply which I had
almost depleted. That is good timing.

As I am losing altitude, the air temparature is increasing again and when I
take off my climbing harness at the hut (now that I'm done with all via ferratas
for the day), it is completly sweat drenched.

<Rimg

  caption="My harness, the light grey is the normal color, everything else is wet from sweat."
/>

After the hut, I get a few more nice views. And more scree, though for some
parts it is that deep and fine, that it nicely dampens the steps going down
and makes you almost slide without much effort. For the very last part some tiredness
finally sets, also because of the heat down in the valley, but it is not as bad
as I was expecting. In the shadow at a forrest border on a grassy hillside I
have one final break.

Around 5:10pm, after about a three hour descent, I reach the train station in
Ehrwald and take the train back at 5:31pm. Overall, the tour took me a bit more than
11 hours of which I spent about 90 minutes on breaks. I ascended about 2340m and
descended about 2100m. The Zugspitze was the highest peak in the tour with a
nominal height of 2962m.

<Rimg src="56.jpeg" caption="The mountain massif I crossed today." />

This was probably the most extreme day “hike” I did so far. The ascent via the
Höllental is definitely worth it with its varied and impressive landscape,
different terrains,
and great views, despite being straineous at times. The journey was definitely
the reward here because the summit was (expectedly) crowded. The descent back
to Ehrwald falls a bit more into the category of type 2 fun
(miserable while it is happening, but fun afterwards due to the accomplishment).
Though there were also some nice parts, it just was not on the same level as
the Höllental.

Back in Munich, I sleep for 10 hours straight and after waking up, my body
aching when I move, I ask myself “Why do I do this stuff?”. Well, the pain
will pass quickly, what stays are the memories of a great mountain tour and
sense of accomplishment.
