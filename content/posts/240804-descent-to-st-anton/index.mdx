We have a relaxed start of the day to recover a bit from yesterday's long tour.
The lines at the breakfast buffet are surprisingly long today. But we have time.
We only need to descent to St Anton today.

After breakfast and packing up, we start the descent in sunny weather. We have
melancholic gazes back to the Patteriol before it disappears behind other
mountains.

At the Verwall lake we have a break because we have a lot of time.

With over an hour to spare, we make it St Anton and relax a bit more near
a fountain in the city core, before catching our train back to Munich, and
bringing our short vacation to an end.
