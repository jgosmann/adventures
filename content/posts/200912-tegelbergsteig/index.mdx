On social media, we usually show off how cool and exciting our lives are
(supposedly). Well, this day trip is a little bit different and this post
might become a little bit of rant. You have been warned.

I was planning to climb the Tegelberg, first following the Gelbe Wand
via ferrata
(difficulty A or B depending on variant) and then the Tegelbergsteig
(difficulty C). After that it is a short 30 minute hike to the Fingersteig
via ferrata (difficulty D) which would be the highlight of the day. Afterwards
I could summit the Branderschrofen at 1881m if time permits and then either
hike down via the Gelbe Wand via ferrata or take the gondola back down.

So I take the train to Füssen and then the bus, which passes through Schwangau
and gives me a view of the famous and iconic fairytale castle Neuschwanstein.

From the parking lot of the gondola station, I start hiking uphill in a fairly
fast pace, occasionally passing other hikers. To get all the things planned done
and still catch the last bus, I have no time to lose. When crossing a small
stream, I get a good view of the rock face that awaits me.

The first part of my route follows the Gelbe Wand via ferrata. A bunch of
other people is already on it, some are obviously doing their first via ferrata.
Gelbe Wand is certainly a good choice for that because along the via ferrata
are information boards teaching you about safety and stuff. I
am of course way faster than most people on there, but they are friendly and let me pass (which is not
much of a problem in the terrain of such an easy via ferrata).

Then, after a bit more walking terrain, I find myself in a queue for the
Tegelbergsteig that branches off of the Gelbe Wand via ferrata. Things are
moving slowly, so I have enough times to take pictures of my surroundings.

After having second breakfast, while standing in the queue, I am finally close to
the starting ladder. But some woman has trouble with the first traverse right
after the ladder (difficulty B/C). Even down from where I am, one can see her
clinging to the steel cable with bent arms, and non-committing, scared attempts
to move the feet forward. Finally, that person decides to climb back down
(forcing the four other people on the ladder to go down again too). Definitely
the right decision, if that spot is already causing problems, the rest of the via
ferrata will be hell and you would annoy everyone waiting behind you while you
get your nerves together.

Once I get to the spot myself, I see why this can cause some trouble. It is
somewhat exposed, the rock is wet (slippery) and polished in some places
(extremely slippery), and it is basically a friction slab. The proper way to
climb this is to carefully place your feet, stem them against the rock with as
much rubber as possible while hanging on your extended arms with your butt away
from the wall. Of course that requires trust in yourself, the grip of the feet,
and seems counter-intuitive because you are leaning away from the wall into open
space.

One might have expected that after the initial hurdle things would move faster.
Well, unfortunately not. Every few moves everything stands still for several
minutes. Over and over again. This is no fun! The group in front of me also
get increasingly annoyed. Somewhere in the middle of the via ferrata there
is a spot wide enough for multiple people to stand. Enough time to have
a relaxed lunch break before things continue to move. An old mountain guide (?)
tells stories of various people he had to get out of dire situations.

I do not expect everyone to be moving as fast through a via ferrata as me. But
I do expect to be able to climb it in roughly the time given in the guide books.
Today I am standing around in the via ferrata longer than I am actually
moving in it. It takes more than twice the time to complete it than it should have taken.
While it is not always possible to let
people pass in more difficult via ferratas, there are usually some wide enough spots, and
there were definitely such spots on this via ferrata. I would expect that such slow people
let at least a few people behind them pass in such spots. Also
you should consider whether a certain via ferrata (or whatever you are doing in the
mountains) is up to your abilities. You do no one a favour if they need to save
you or even when you block tens of people on a via ferrata (I was certainly not the only one annoyed).

At least the last tenth or so, when things where finally moving fast (because
the slow people finally finished the via ferrata), where some fun, somewhat technical,
climbing, passing through a chimney with a rock window hinting at the sun
awaiting at top (the via ferrata is in the shade of the north face, the reason
why some stretches of rock were wet).

Done with the first via ferrata, I look at the clock. If I am really fast I might
still be able to do the Fingersteig. So I pick up fast hiking pace again, but
unfortunately miss the sign for the Fingersteig behind a tree and descend a bit
too much. Going up again is exhausting and the detour has cost me too much time.
If I would start the Fingersteig now there would not be any safety margin that
would allow me to take more time than estimated. I decide not to risk it, also
because the time pressure would increase the chance of mistakes that get me in
bigger trouble than just missing the last bus. I cannot summit the
Branderschrofen either with the remaining time. So I take the gondola back down
(which allows me to catch one bus earlier than hiking down) and start the trip
back home.
