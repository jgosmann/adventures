Today we are aiming for another top 100 climb, the three pitch Star Chek right
above the Cheakamus river. With a crux pitch of 5.9, it is easy climbing, but
nicely exposed and has a great scenery. We mistook one of the rappel anchors
mid-pitch as the end of the second pitch, so we actually ended up doing it in
four pitches. Also, you actually walk-in and walk-off and do not use the rappel
anchors. Back in the days people rappeled in, but this is now frowned uppon as
there apparently have been several near misses with loose rocks.

After finishing this climb, we still have about half a day and decide to check
out Area 44.

{{<loc "49.84250" "-123.14731" "11">}}

There we look for another top 100 climb, Rocky Horror (5.10b). But
we have some trouble finding it at first, go too far, wander through newly
developed areas that are not even in our guide book, before making it back to
the right spot. I flash this incredibly awesome climb with some exposed,
slightly scary parts and some nice cracks. I even do a hand jam at one spot.
It also has exactly the right amount of scariness for me at the moment to get
used again to the feeling while still being in control.

To finish the day off, we do Attachment Theory another really fun 5.10b.
Slightly reachy with some dynamic throws and foot swings.
