The day starts with a really good and rich Italian breakfast with bread, ham,
cheese, eggs, mozzarella, biscuits, yoghurt, juice etc. The first part of today
still goes through some impressive mountains and has nice downhill rides. Again
there are some closed parts, but at least the detours have somewhat decent
signage (in a few places signs are missing anyways).

At the Lago di Santa Croce, I have a first break. It has only been 25km which is
a bit early for a break, but at least it is about a quarter of today's distance
and the next part will be mostly on roads. Thus, it is unclear when the next
opportunity for a break will be.

After passing Vittorio Veneto, the mountains are suddenly behind me. Shortly
after, around 1pm, I find a shady place for a second break at 50km. The sun is
burning now quite intensely and it must be around 28 or 29°C. Much warmer than
the last days, but I am also further South now and at less elevation.

From now on it is pretty flat with a few exceptions. However, much more parts
are on roads, though, mostly they are not very busy. In Conegliano, I stock up
on food again (this time I remember to weigh the fruits myself) and get my first
real Italian gelato on this vacation. It is great and makes the heat a bit more
endurable.

Close to Treviso, in Villorba, I stay at another bed and breakfast. Again there
are some language barriers, but they are circumvented with the help of
a translator app on the phone. The host is very friendly and even orders and
picks up a pizza for me (as there are no restaurants close by). I enjoy it
on the patio in the warm evening.

Today's distance were 102km which took me 5:37h. My average speed was 18.1km/h
and I reached a maximum speed of 48.2km/h.
