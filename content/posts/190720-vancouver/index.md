We wake up early and drive back to Vancouver. Christine and Vera drop me off at
the hostel before 10am before saying good bye and continuing to the airport.
I will stay two more nights in Vancouver. Conveniently, I can already check-in
at the hostel, but have a room mate this time.

I leave my luggage in the hostel and start exploring Vancouver on foot. I walk
up Granville Street in the Entertainment District (where my hostel is) towards
Canada Place where large cruise ships dock.

Next I walk through Gastown and see the famous steam-powered clock.

From Gastown it is just a short walk to Chinatown. There I have a steamed-bun
with pork filling as a snack.

In Chinatown, I visit the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Chinese gardens which are apparently
true in style to gardens in China. I attend an interesting tour, included in the
admission, explaining the guiding principles of the garden design (Feng Shui, Yin
and Yang, symbolism). It is quite interesting and the garden is a nice, tranquil
place.

While walking around, I noticed that Vancouver has some good bicycle lanes (wide,
separated from the traffic and clear signage). So I decide to rent a bicycle.
First I go to the Queen Elizabeth park where you can get a nice view of the city
with the mountains in the background.

From there I go back to the Seaside and follow it towards Granville Island.
I walk over the island with its many artisan shops, a public market, and some
buskers. Then I cross the bay back towards downtown via the Granville Bridge and
head towards Stanley Park.

In Stanley Park, I first cycle through the old-growth rain forrest. It is
beatiful and has some impressively large trees. One point of interest is a giant
hollow tree. I like how the forrest smells of the firs and other trees mix with
salty air coming in from the sea.

I leave the forrest and follow the coastal path around the peninsula giving
varying views of Vancouver, the surrounding mountains, and the sea.

I make it back to the bike rental place in just under the five hour cut-off for
a half day rental. Then I have a nice Burrito for dinner before finding a book
store to buy something to read for my flight back. I already finished the book
I brought on the trip from home and left it with Vera (it was an English book)
to not have to carry it back. I also get some groceries for the next day and do
laundry. After 10 days of climbing this was definitely necessary to have some
clean cloths again.
