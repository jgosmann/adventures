We have another weekend with splendid weather. It has been quite warm the whole
week already and the snow cover declined. Thus, we are leaving the snow shoes at
home this time, and only take much lighter ice cleats with us. We start our
ascent of the Krottenkopf (2086m) from Oberau.

The first part is completely snow free. But after gaining some height, we start
to encounter snow patches that slowly turn into a continuous snow cover. It is
packed enough that our cleats give us sufficient traction.

As we reach the top of the ridge line, we have the choice of crossing the
Bischof or traversing its North West face without summiting it. While there are
tracks, there are also multiple stretches where the tracks are covered with
snow, probably by the wind. It is also a steep slope so we have to take some
time in those stretches to create new steps with enough care to avoid plummeting
down. The snow cover is a bit unpredictable. Sometimes its frozen surface holds
our weight, but every know and then a foot breaks through and the leg disappears
knee deep (or deeper) into the snow.

Eventually we make it out of that part and get into the warm sun.

Next, we traverse below the Kareck and Oberer Rißkopf. There we have tracks all
the way, which allows us to move faster. However, there are still occasional
spots were the snow is not sufficiently compacted and occasionally one of our
legs disappears completely in a waist deep hidden hole. From the Weilheimer
Hütte on, the snow cover gets very patchy and much less deep again. Thus the
final part of the ascent is easy.

We have the summit pretty much for us alone. Only one other person appears to
soon descent with skis (despite the little snow). After a break we ascent the
nearby summit of the Oberer Rißkopf (2049m) on the opposite side of the
Weilheimer Hütte. There it has much more snow again.

We then descent to the Esterbergalm through more deep snow with some more hidden
holes for our legs to disappear. But mostly the snow is solid and packed enough.
However, the descent starts to get lengthy and slow as we get lower and the snow
becomes more mushy. But we push through and conditions get better past the
Esterbergalm as we descent to Farchant.

It was a long tour today taking us 8:10h without major breaks. We ascended
about 1650m and descended about 1600m.
