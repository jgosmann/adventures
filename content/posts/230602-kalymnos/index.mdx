Surprisingly, it more or less rains all day. Thus, we are forced to take a lazy
rest day reading, watching Youtube videos and so on. For lunch, we visit a café
where I have a sandwich. Even the drop-in yoga class gets cancelled as the
rooftop, where it is held, is covered in puddles. Apparently, it is the first
time ever that it had to be cancelled! Instead, we have some drinks in the
Scorpion pub where they play rock classics. Coincidentally, Susi and Jörg pass
by and join us. Later w have dinner at the Aegean Tavern where I get grilled
Kalamari and cheesecake.
