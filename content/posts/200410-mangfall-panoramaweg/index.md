Despite the Corono lock down and social distancing measures, we are still
allowed to leave our homes for outdoor sports if we do them alone. Thus, I use
the excellent weather on Good Friday for a cycling tour.

Just a few kilometers from my home, I hit the Mangfallradweg (Mangfall cycling
trail) and follow it. The first 20km still lead me through Munich, many suburbs,
and along some bigger roads, but with separated bicycle paths and not much
traffic anyways thanks to the lock down. I also pass one suburb of Munich with
some small streets and nice old buildings.

After that part, the landscape gets finally nicer including a few hills and some
small spruce forests. When the view opens up, it is possible to see the distant
mountains of the Alps in the haze.

At some point I hit the river Mangfall and follow the flat trail next to it.

Before it is time to leave the river again, I have a lunch break. I will need the
regained strength for the next part on the Sempt-Mangfall cycling trail which
will be the hilliest part of the tour.

I ride through more forests and over rolling hills. Most of the climbs are not
too long or too steep, but they are a bit energy-sapping nevertheless. The
downhills part, however, are really enjoyable. At one particular short and steep
stretch of broad, well paved road I hit a maximum speed of 52km/h on my bike!

Finally, I hit the Panoramaweg Isar-Inn (panoramic cycling trail Isar-Inn) which
I will follow back to Munich. One last steep climb up a hill and from now on the
terrain will be flatter and going downhill on average. The part of the trail
that I am riding is not very panoramic, however, as it leads mostly through
forests. In one of those, I take a second longer break to regain strength for
the final push.

Back at home I have pedaled a distance of 105km which took me (not counting
breaks) five hours. That is a very decent average of 21km/h.
