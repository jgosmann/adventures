Today's weather forecast is a bit better than yesterday, but we still cannot
rely on completely stable weather. Therefore, we again planned a somewhat
shorter tour onto the Karkopf (2948m).

After following a gravel road for a while, we leave the trail and ascend
a grassy slope along a stream, searching for our own way. Eventually, the grass
recedes and gives way to scree. Across these rocks, we need to get to a small
glacier, cross it or maybe be able to go around it, then climb onto the ridge
line and follow it to the summit.

But at an elevation of about 2600m, when looking back, the clouds coming towards
us look quite dark. We are not sure whether they might bring rain and
potentially a thunderstorm. We then decide to play it safe — especially on the
glacier or ridge line we wouldn't want to be caught in such conditions — and
start to descend back down.

Back on the gravel road, the weather looks much more friendly again. So we have
a break near the river flowing through the valley. Afterwards, we scout the
approach to the Patteriol North-East ridge line. This could save us some
essential time in our planned attempt, and the approach branches off our way
back to the cabin anyway.

The first part of the approach goes up a grassy slope interspersed with rocks
before crossing a stream into a steep overgrown slope. Finding this point takes
us a little bit time and finding the trail within all the vegetation isn't
always straightforward either. We make it halfway up before we decide to turn
around for now. At least we now know where we have to head and what awaits us.

Shortly before we reach the hut, a few raindrops fall, but not enough to really
get us wet. Apparently, we didn't need to turn around from the Karkopf ascent,
but given the information we had at the time, it was still the right decision.
Excluding the break, we took a bit less than 5 hours and ascended and descended
1200m of elevation.

The remainder of the afternoon we spend planning our actual ascent of the
Patteriol tomorrow and prepare our equipment. After a delicious deer ragout with
thyme-lingonberry sauce and
[Germknödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germkn%C3%B6del) for dessert, we go
to bed quite early. Tomorrow we have to wake up at 4am.

Luckily, it is the first night without any load snorers in the room, so that
I can actually get some good sleep.
