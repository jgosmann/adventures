Fabian, Martin, Kristina, and I have planned an extended alpine weekend in the
Ötztal. It is known for its winter sport areas and the oldest natural mummy
[Ötzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi) (the Iceman). At 7:50am, Martin,
Kristina, and I board the train to Kufstein in the Munich East station. In
there, we meet Fabian who already boarded at the central station.

From Kufstein, we take a Railjet to the Ötztal train station. It is quite
crowded. They stop the train at the next station and demand that everyone
without a seat gets off for “safety” reasons before the train will continue its
journey. Unfortunately, we are part of those without a seat. Luckily, there is
another train on the opposite side of the platform going to Innsbruck, leaving
in three minutes. Getting onto that train is a good decision because not
everyone in the Railjet is willing to leave and it will accumulate a delay of
more than an hour. The train, we are on now, is a bit slower than the planned
connection and we have to change trains in Innsbruck once more, but it still
saves us some time. At the Ötztal train station, we have a short wait for a bus
that brings us to the touristy Sölden (where parts of the James Bond movie
Spectre where shot). There we have another ten minute wait for the final bus
connection to Vent.

After a short moment of figuring out directions, we can finally start our ascent
to the hut Breslauer Hütte at an elevation of 2844m where we will stay the
first night.

The trail is not the most beautiful because it runs below a ski lift. However,
we already get some amazing views of the surrounding mountains.

After about 2 hours and ascending about 914m, we reach the hut.

At the hut, we have dinner (vegetable soup, pork roast with mashed potatoes, and
yoghurt with berries for dessert), discuss the next day and prepare our packs
for the next day. Then we play a round of
[Wizard](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(card_game)>) before going to bed
quite early. Tomorrow we have to get up early!
