On today's snow show hike, Fabian and I plan to summit the Hochplatte (1592m)
and Seekarkreuz (1601m). This tour isn't quite as long as the last one and we
can sleep at least 30 minutes longer.

After a train and bus ride, we start South West of Kreuth, a point we also
passed last year <Link to="/posts/220807-fuer-andi-leonhardstein/">when we were climbing
at the Leonhardstein</Link>. For a while, we overtake quite a number of people
on skis, but people with snow shoes are a rare sight.

Eventually, we make it up to plateau from where we can see the Seekarkreuz. But
first, we turn right and ascend the last few meters of elevation to the
Hochplatte.

Though the temperature is not very cold – in fact, the temperature climbed even
above freezing at an elevation of about 1400m – it is quite windy on the summit
and we quickly descent again to have a lunch break.

After the lunch break it gets quite strenuous to head over to the Seekarkreuz.
We have to pass through an area where a lot of snow has collected, and not many
people travelled across it to pack it down. In addition, the temperatures are
now high enough for the snow to get moist and sticky which causes it to be extra
heavy and to collect a bit on top of our snow shoes and boots. The weight has to
be lifted on every step.

But we make it through and get sight of the summit that we ascend along the
ridge line.

On top of the Seekarkreuz we spend some more time. The summit is quite busy and
there are at least as many snow shoers as skiers. Even some people with neither
because our descend trail to Lenggries is quite packed.

Today's hike took us about 6h with an ascent and descent of about 1130m.
