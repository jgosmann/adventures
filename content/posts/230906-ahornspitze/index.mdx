Today we plan to summit the Ahornspitze (‚Äúmaple peak‚Äù, 2973m). We take the gondola up to about
1970m. Around the gondola's top station, it is a bit touristy and we even pass
a vending machine in the vicinity.

But soon we are on smaller hiking trails and already get some views of the
Ahornspitze with the sun just starting to peak over it.

We continue to the Karl von Edel hut, where we have a very short break at about
one hour into the hike. From here, we leave the standard trail to the summit, but
head towards the ridge line known as the Popbergschneid.

As we are on the ridge line (about 30 minutes later) we get a great view of the
Floitental and the bordering mountains, including the <Link

to="/posts/230813-zsigmondyspitze/">Zsigmondyspitze</Link>, that I both recently
climbed.

From here we follow the ridge line, which gives us great views and almost no
other person is seen.

The crux of the path is to scramble around a broken off rock tooth. Afterwards,
we also pass a few slightly exposed spots, but nothing too bad.

Soon the ridge line merges back onto main trail up to the Ahornspitze. It is
quite overrun. Until we reach the summit, it is still a steep ascent of a few
hundred meters of elevation. It took me about 3:10h of hiking in total to reach
it, my parents are about 20 minutes slower.

The view from here is amazing.

After a break, we also go the few meters from the Southern to the slightly
smaller Northern summit, which also has the summit cross.

From here we also get a good view towards the Northern mountains and Mayrhofen
in the valley.

We descend via the standard trail to the Karl von Edel hut. However, it is not
quite as nice as the Popbergschneid. It takes us about 1:30h to go down.

At the hut we enjoy some drinks and cake before walking back (~1h) to the
gondola to take it back down. We covered an elevation difference of 1020m today.
