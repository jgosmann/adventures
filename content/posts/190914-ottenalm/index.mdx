This weekend my parents are visiting me in Munich on their way back home from
a vacation in the Alps. Because of the good weathe,r we decide to do an outing
to the Ottenalm in Austria for some via ferrata action.

From the bus, it is a walk of about an hour to the Ottenalm. Different via
ferratas are offered there. We do the Bergkameradensteig (roughly translates to
mountain companions' track) which has a difficulty rating of D.

After finishing the ferrata, we take a short break before heading back down to
the Ottenalm. My parents have a drink there, while I tackle a second, harder
ferrata, the Ottenalm-Direttissima (difficulty D/E). It has almost no iron rungs
for the feet. Thus, I switch to climbing shoes.

Both were quite nice via ferratas that require a quite a bit of technique and
arm strength. After some food at the Ottenalm, we descend back to the village
from where we take a taxi (as there is no bus connection until later in the day)
to Kufstein, where our train back to Munich will leave. Before that, we have
enough time for a quick stroll through the quite nice old city core and getting
a look at the famous Kufstein castle.
