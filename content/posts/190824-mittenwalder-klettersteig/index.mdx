Today Fabian and I plan to do the Mittenwalder Klettersteig ([via
ferrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_ferrata) of Mittenwald). We take the
train at 7:13am from the Munich central station to Mittenwald. From the train
station there, it is just a short walk to the gondola which brings us up to an
elevation of 2244 meters.

We wanted to do the Karwendelspitz via ferrata which would bring us to the
summit of the Westliche Karwendelspitze first. Unfortunately, it is closed, so
we skip the summit (that is also reachable with a normal hiking trail) and
immediately start with the Mittenwalder Klettersteig. It is not a difficult via
ferrata (A/B on a scale that goes up to G by now) and on some of the easiest
parts we do not even secure ourselves with our [via ferrata
sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_ferrata#Via_ferrata_set). This saves us
some time and reduces the risk that we will be caught in a thunderstorm later
during the day. We see some people who did not even bring a via ferrata set.

After the via ferrata we descend to the Brunnsteinhütte where we have a drink
before continuing our descent back to Mittenwald. Instead of the direct descent,
we chose the Leitersteig that is nicer and brings us across a suspension bridge.
This one is higher and probably longer than the Sky Pilot suspension bridge in
Squamish. It also allows you to look through the bottom. Much more exciting than
in Squamish!

While descending the last few meters we hear thunder announcing the forecasted
thunderstorms. But there is not much rain, only a couple of drops. It is barely
worth getting out a rain jacket. Anyways, it is good timing and we are glad that
we used the nice weather as it lasted. Our timing gets even better as we manage
to catch the train back to Munich just a minute before it leaves (and we did not
look up the departure time beforehand).

While the via ferrata was no challenge, it is very pretty and gives great views.
Definitely worth doing! Including our breaks we took a little bit under 7 hours
in total, ascended 405m and descended 1774m. I recorded a peak height of 2330m.
