For breakfast, Kristina made some bread buns. It's great to have a person in the
group that is constantly baking things! Today's hike is onto the Besler (1680m).
First the trail leads through the shade of forest and then opens up to an
incredible view of the surrounding mountains.

Eventually, we reach the rocky formation of the Besler. We climb it with an easy
(A/B) via ferrata, except for Martin who takes the normal hiking trail around
with Jonas on his back. The weather is better than expected, and after a lunch
break, we visit the other two (lower) summits of the ridge line. As we descend
back to our starting point, it finally gets cloudy, but stays dry.

At home we relax a bit with [Radler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandy#Radler)
or wheat beer and a banana cake (that, of course, Kristina baked). Then Susanne,
Fabian, and I go for a run. As I'm not expecting that we are doing a strenuous
hike tomorrow, it is ok if my legs get even more sore. As we reach the point
farthest away from our vacation home at a little church and we turn around, we
see that the sky behind us has gotten quite dark. Soon the first rain drops fall
that quickly turn into a downpour soaking us completely wet. In the distance
there is some lighting. Then, suddenly, as we are passing through a little
forest, there is a flash of light to the right of us and without delay we hear
the thunder. This lightning was way closer than we would have liked and makes us
run fast. Susanne runs her fastest kilometer ever in just 4 minutes and 20
seconds (Fabian and I aren't any slower). Luckily, there isn't any more
lightning. As we arrive back home, how could it be any other way, it stops to
rain.

For dinner, we have vegetarian burgers with buns made by Kristina. Afterwards we
end the day with a yoga session led by Susanne.
