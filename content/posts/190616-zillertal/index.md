Today we sleep a little bit longer. It rained a bit during the night and is
significantly colder than the previous day. Also, the forecast for the rest of
the day does not look very promising. Thus, we return the rented crash pads and
drive to Zell to do a little hike going up partly the Zellberg.

 While some of us only make it up halfway of the 900m ascent and then turn
around to go back to a café, Fabian, Jade, Lisa, Jason, and I do the full hike
of about 12km. We get some nice views before going back a down a pretty steep
descent and returning to Zell along the Ziller.

 On the way down we cross the Talbach with an impressive waterfall that has
a via ferrata next to it tha looks quite fun. Hopefully, I get the chance to do
it one day (but today I do not have my harness and via ferrata set with me).

For all of the hike, it stayed dry and the weather was probably better for
bouldering than yesterday. But so is life. Before we get back into the cars for
the drive back to Munich, we have a coffee (and other drinks) in a café that has
a pretty tasty chai latte.

All in all a pretty good weekend even though the weather could have been
slightly better. I really enjoyed the boulder problems in the Zillertal. It
actually might have been my favourite bouldering place so far. Though, Halfway
Log Dump on the Bruce Peninsula wasn't bad either. But the Zillertal is
definitely more enjoyable than the Niagara Glen with its painfully sharp holds.
