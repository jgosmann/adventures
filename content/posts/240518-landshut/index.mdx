The weather god gifted us with sunny weather for exactly the three day long
weekend. This gives me finally the chance for a long intended bicycle tour to
Regensburg. Today, I start from Munich and will go to Landshut. With 83km it
isn't that far and I can have a relaxed start at around 9:40am.

The route mostly follows the river Isar northbound. The riding conditions
are almost perfect. It's not too warm; there are some clouds and many trees
provide shade. Only the wind is a bit stronger than expected, but at least not
a full on head-wind.

The closer I get to Freising, the more noticeable the noise of starting and
landing airplanes from the nearby Munich airport gets. Around noon, I reach
Freising and walk my bicycle a bit through the central pedestrian area with some
pretty buildings, a large farmer's market, and some quiet side streets. I also
take detour to the cathedral before continuing on my route. But not for long.
With the first 45km down, it is time for a proper lunch break on a fallen tree
at the Isar shore. During my break I can watch some dragon flies, butterflies,
some sort of coot, and a pair of rafts coming down the Isar.

At 1pm, I continue to Moosburg. It doesn't even take me an hour to get there.
It is now less than 20km to Landshut and I am way too early! The central city
square is unfortunately a large construction site. I'm sure it would have been
nice without the construction. But I find a nice bench on a different square
next to the church where I have another break to read a bit and kill some time.

From here, the route follows the Isar less closely and the last bit is along
a larger street. Luckily, it has a separated and quite wide bicycle path so that
riding here feels safe even if the views aren't as beautiful. The wind is now
more in my back and so I can really make some distance here. I end up in a game
of cat and mouse with two gravel bikers as we repeatedly overtake each other.

Around 4:20pm, I reach Landshut and kill some more time on a bench before the
check-in of the youth hostel, where I'll be staying tonight, opens. I booked
a single room with bathroom, but they made a mistake and confirmed it without
having a single room available. So I am put into a dorm room without any other
guests. This room doesn't have a bathroom and I have to use the shared showers
and toilets on the floor. But it isn't that bad as everything is clean and
I only have to pay the lower rate of the dorm room despite having it all to
myself.

After unloading my bicycle and having a shower, I walk over to the Trausnitz
castle towering over the city. There is a free brass concert going on.
I consider staying, but I'm just too hungry. After enjoying the good view over
the city, I do small round through the castle garden, pass by another good view
point, and descent into the city core, where I have dinner at a highly rated
Indian place. The food is good, but not better than some other Indian places in
Munich. So it seems a bit overrated.

Being fed, I explore the old city core a bit more. Finally, I hike up to the
castle again to enjoy the sunset from up there before returning to the youth
hostel.

I took about 4h to cycle the 83km which gives an average speed of 20.4km/h. This
includes some parts where I had to walk my bike. My maximum speed was 35km/h.
