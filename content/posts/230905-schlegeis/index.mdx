Today we are at the Schlegeis dam. It features a via ferrata that climbs up the
131 meter wall. It starts out as a slanted ladder that gets slowly steeper.
Eventually the route begins to traverse to the right.

For the finish, one can choose between the easy variant (B) going further to the
right or the slightly overhanging route straight up (C/D). I decide for
the latter. While this via ferrata is quite unconventional in that it does not
make use of actual rock and it is more or less a ladder, it does have a quite
exposed feeling with the unobstructed view all the way down.

After completing the via ferrata, we enjoy the views from the dam and have some
lunch.

After the lunch break, we attend a guided tour of the dam before returning to
Mayrhofen.
