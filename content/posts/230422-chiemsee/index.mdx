The weather has been pretty wet the last weeks and a general improvement is not
in sight. But this Saturday turned out to be an exception with sunny weather and
the temperature climbing above 20°C. Martin, Kristina, and I used this
opportunity for a cycling tour to the lake Chiemsee.

Barely out of Munich, near Vaterstetten, we get the first great view of the
Alps.

Soon, about 30km into the ride, we have a first break on a hill with an even
better panoramic view of the Alps. We can even clearly see the Großvenediger,
which is pretty amazing given that is about 100km away. <Link

Next, we pass through Wasserburg (“water castle”) at the river Inn with its
colorfully painted houses in the old city core.

We continue through lovely Bavarian landscape and have another break at a small
lake.

After that, it is only a short stretch until we make it to the lake Chiemsee.
We get some drinks and ice cream near the lakeside. The we have still some time
to kill before the train takes us back to Munich and sit on a bench with nice
view of the lake to the mountains.

In total, we travelled a distance of about 100km on our bikes today (my track is
missing a little part in the beginning and back in Munich I forgot to track the
way home, so it is a little less in the elevation profile). It took us 5 hours
and 40 minutes without stops given an average speed of 17.3km/h. We've reached
a maximum speed of 52km/h.
