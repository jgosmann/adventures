Kristina and Martin had a car available this weekend, so we decided to hike
a mountain that is not easily reachable by public transport: the Guffert which is
the first high mountain in its area coming from the north.

I get picked up at 6:45am to get an early start and avoid the afternoon heat. On
the way up, we take a trail that circles around the the north side of the
mountain and then goes pretty much straight up. Right from the start it is
a narrow and sometimes alpine trail. Then the last few hundred meters of
elevation often require a little bit help of the hands for balance. A short
section is even secured with a steel rope in via ferrata style. That definitely
makes for an interesting and fun climb up the mountain.

We have lunch on the summit. From there we can see the first few smaller
mountains of the alps as well as the ridge lines of higher mountains of the
Karwendel (where I did the Mittenwalder Klettersteig last weekend). A big black
crow surprises us by making calls that sound like a cellphone notification
sound.

Afterwards, we descend via the trail on the southface. It gets quite hot because
we have to descend quite a lot below the treeline before we actually enter some
shady forrest. Back to the car, we shortly step into a nearby creek. The cold
water is comforting in the first moment, but it quickly gets too cold to stay in
the water.

We ascended and descended about 1500m. The summit was at 2195m. We were quite
fast and were back to the car in less than 6:40h.
