It is our last day in Grindelwald, so we are only doing a short tour today. We
take the gondola up once more to the Eiger glacier station. From there, we hike
a short bit to the old Mittellegi cabin. It used to be on the Mittellegi ridge
line and was transported here to serve as a tiny museum, when it was replaced
by a newer cabin.

Next, we cross a ravine and ascent on an alpine trail to the Alte Guggihütte
(“old Guggi cabin”, about 2345m). The trail has some steep, uncomfortable
gravel stretches, and a few spots of easy climbing. We happen to see quite a few
ibexes.

The very last few meters, we leave the official trail and follow a faint,
exposed trail to the cabin. The cabin has definitely seen better times and
deteriorated quite a bit.

After a break, we descent on the same way and continue to the Kleine Scheidegg.
There we see the famous hotels from where the Eiger North Face aspirants were
watched back in the day. We have lunch (burger with some delicious Rösti french
fries) and then take the cog railway back down to Grindelwald.

Today we only hiked for about 3h with 470m ascent and 660m descent.
