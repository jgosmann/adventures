It is a German Father's Day tradition to take a handcart with a crate of beer
and walk it with some buddies into nature, while getting drunk. Due to the
social distancing rules still in effect, this is not really an option this year.
Well, to be honest, it has never been what I liked to do or have done on
Father's Day. Instead I decided to do another cycling tour north east of
Munich.

For the first part (which is partially missing in the GPS track above), I do not
take an official cycling route, but my usual path to the Unterföhring location
of my workplace, which I know well and is a reasonably nice bike ride for being
within city limits. From there, I head roughly in the direction of the Sempt-Isen
cycling route that I want to follow towards the east. However, there is
a highway in-between that I somehow need to cross. My only detailed map is on
a GPS device with limited resolution, making it hard to see where crossings might be.

After hitting a first dead end, I see something promising on my map. I backtrack
a little bit and then find a very narrow trail in the woods leading slightly
upwards. I am a bit sceptical; this does not seem like an official path, why
would it lead to a bridge over the highway? But lo and behold, the forest opens
up and there is a wide bridge. Instead of being paved,
it is covered in gravel and I realize that this bridge is not intended for human
usage. It is probably for animals to be able to cross the highway!

As I do not see any bears, tigers, or other dangerous animals on it, I gladly
use the bridge. It leads me to an actual gravel road, which is a bit
uncomfortable to ride a bike on as the gravel is mostly small pebbles.

Not long after, following the highway, I get to a canal that I also need to
cross. This time, there is a bridge right there; and a tunnel underneath the
highway that I could have used if I had taken a slightly different route.

Now I head north to Ismaning where I reach the Sempt-Isen trail. It leads
me through German farmland and past a few small lakes. Unfortunately, with head
winds, but at least without many hills and a slight downhill incline on average.

I leave Sempt-Isen trail in Erding, a town well known for its wheat beer, to
follow the Durch das Erdinger Land trail (“through the countryside of Erding”).

After about 60km and a short break, I hit the river Isar. With a small detour
through a forest area, I will follow it straight back to Munich. There are lot
of other people enjoying the river landscape on rafts, canoes, kayaks, swimming,
sun-bathing, hiking or cycling like me. Along the way I make another stop for
a longer break as I notice fatigue starting to set in and my saddle
getting more and more uncomfortable.

Eventually, I make it back home after about 104km that took me about five hours,
stops and breaks of about 90 minutes excluded. My cycling speed averaged
20.7km/h.
