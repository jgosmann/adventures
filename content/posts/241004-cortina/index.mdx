Another rainy day, but we decide one hike in the rain per vacation suffices and
keep it relaxed. In the morning, we stroll through the city. On the way back, we
buy some potato salad and fish fingers for lunch. The afternoon we spend at the
local museum; learning a bit about the history of Cortina and fossils that have
been found here.
