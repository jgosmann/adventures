The alarm rings and wakes me up. But it is not my alarm, it is the alarm of the
person sleeping in the same hostel room. He ignores it and goes back sleep,
while I lie awake the next 30 minutes wishing I was still asleep. Well,
I suppose that is what you get for being too cheap to get a hotel room.

Most of today I actually do not spend in Vancouver, but near Squamish. I take
a shuttle to the Sea to Sky Gondola.

While gondolas are somewhat rare in Canada, I did many gondola rides in the Alps
where they are a bit more a means of transportations to or from the
hiking trails and less of a tourist attraction in itself. Actually, one of my
main reasons for me to come here is to walk across the Sky Pilot Suspension
bridge (as seen on Altered Carbon), not the gondola itself.

For some reason the bridge looks much higher and more exposed on photos than it
felt standing on there. But what you cannot see on the pictures is how much it
actually shakes when people walk over it.

After walking across the suspension bridge I follow an easy interpretative trail
about the Squamish (as in the First Nation, not the city) and after that a trail
with some major lookouts.

Finished with enjoying the views, I want to leave the crowds behind me and go
for a trail called Sparky's Spin. It is more advanced and you have to pay
a little bit attention to the (many) trail markers. The trail cuts below the
gondola into the forrest and than joins the Sea to Summit trail that leads up
from the gondola station in the valley to the summit station. On the first part
I enjoy being alone. Once I join the Sea to Summit trail I meet some more people
(I overtake a bunch), but it is still far from being overcrowded.

When I get back to the summit, I still have time and do the Highline trail. It
is a bit off the main trails, also advanced, and leads to another lookout. I am
the only person on the whole trail. I can enjoy the view from the lookout just
on my own and have a break there until it is time to head back. It sort of
amazes me how lazy people are that the main trails are super crowded while I am
the only person here where it is just a few more meters further away and
a little bit more difficult trail. But I am certainly not complaining.

On the way back down, I can spot pitch 1 (Women in Comfortable Shoes) and 2 of
Stairway to Heaven with climbers on it. It is nice to get this perspective on
the climb.

Back in Vancouver, I buy jeans because here I can go to an American Eagle store
and be sure to get my size, whereas in Germany I can rarely find my size (and
that makes buying jeans in Germany really annoying).

In the evening, I visit the Richmond Night Market. At least half of it consists
of food stalls, selling mostly more or less strange asian fusion dishes. I stick
to the less strange variations and have a selection of [dim
sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum) and
[takoyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takoyaki).

There are also a bunch of carnival games (is that what you call them?). At one
you can win a giant plush toy if you manage to hang on a (rolling) monkey bar
for two minutes. I am tempted to try it because I would like to know whether
I can do it (with my rock climbing training). But reason and the price of $10
deter me (for $5 I probably would have done it). Also, if I win one of those
plush toys there would be no way to fit in my luggage on my flight. However,
I watch a number of other people try it and no one succeeds. The first minute
seems easy, by ninty seconds (at latest) they all start to slowly slip (hands
getting sweaty? or just getting tired?), then try to adjust their grip which
makes the bar rotate on them and they fall off. There are similar monkey bars in
some climbing gyms. If I come across one, I will try it there.

The third major type of stalls are those selling mostly cheap low-quality
products. Though, some also seem to have stuff that is more novel or more high
quality.

Finally, there is a stage where groups like [Shooting Star
Idols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPJpQ-BcIQs), “celebrating and
popularizing the best of Asian idol culture in Canada”, perform.
