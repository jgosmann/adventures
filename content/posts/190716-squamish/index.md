Today is the day. The day Vera and I attempt of the 15 pitch Stairway to Heaven
all the way up the Chief. A big challenge! We wake up before sunrise to be able
to use as much of the 15 to 16 hours of daylight as possible. We start with the
first pitch Women in Comfortable Shoes (5.10a) between 6am and 7am. It is
a quite exciting start to the day, traversing a slab on a thin dyke with minimal
hand holds. It requires a lot of balance and I take one fall.

{{< rimg src="IMG_20190715_090556.jpg" caption="Start of the first pitch following a dyke">}}

The second pitch (5.10a) moves upwards, first on a layback crack, but then
transitions into quite runout slab. Even the slab crux is runout. Once you get
above a certain height from the last bolt, you really do not want to fall on
slab. But once you get to that height, downclimbing to bail also seems to risky,
so you have to keep it mentally together, trust your feet, and continue on. The
long distances between the bolts also require close attention to the line of the
route because you cannot just follow the bolts.  I am relieved to make it to the
end of the pitch without a fall.

Next we have to hike a short bit to the Mañana slab. There one of the crux
pitches (5.10c) awaits. At least with reasonable bolt distances. Nevertheless,
it is still scary and hard. To not waste too much time (we are on a tight
schedule, the first two pitches took us about 2 hours and we should not get any
slower than that to complete all pitches in daylight), I pull on some draws.
Unfortunately, this does not help with the crux move (last bolt is too low). In
addition, the crux is somewhat cryptic. Do you go left where there are some
crystals that give a tiny bit to hold onto with your hands, but where there is
only a tiny thing for your foot that seems impossible to stand on? Or do you go
right with slightly better feet, but even worse handholds? I attempt to start
each variant several times, but do not feel confident enough to commit and
weight the rope again. Finally, I decide that it has to be the left variant.
I place my foot carefully, then tense my leg muscles and start lifting my weight
up.  I ignore the pain of the tiny rock feature pressing with all my body weight
into my toe.  To my surprise the foot holds. A few more moves and I can clip the
next bolt.

Another easier (5.10a) pitch follows. After traversing another dyke, it brings
more runout friction slab, but not quite as scary as the other runout parts. We
again have to walk a little bit to the next pitch and thus coil up the rope.

By accident we walk around the fifth pitch. Due to the tight schedule we decide
not to go back and climb it. The later pitches are supposed to be better anyways
(though, it was some enjoyable climbing up to here too if you ignore the
runouts).

{{< rimg src="10.jpg" caption="Above the fifth pitch">}}

The sixth pitch starts with nice layback crack and a super high first bolt.
According to the guide book you can place a cam in the crack to add some
protection before the bolt, but we do not have a cam. Luckily, it is easy
climbing up to there and even the crux of the pitch is just 5.9. To be as safe
as possible, I hand my backpack to Vera, so I have less weight. It will make
climbing a lot harder for her, but she will be safe following on top rope.
I reach the bolt without problems and would have climbed the pitch clean, if
I did not accidentally clipped one of the slings, I was carrying, entangled with
the rope. To entangle the mess, I had to weigh the rope.

{{< rimg src="12.jpg" caption="Belaying on top of the sixth pitch">}}

Now we have to do some hiking again. It is the longest, but also last hiking
part (except maybe very short hikes before the last two pitches). The following
pitches will be face climbing up the main part of the Chief.  To get there, we
have to go along some (in my opinion) wide ledges. However, Vera is slightly
scared. What we are looking for is an exposed ledge called the Bellygood Ledge.
At two points, where the ledges get narrower, we set up a tree belay, thinking
that this might be the start of the Bellygood Ledge.

{{< rimg src="11.jpg" caption="Enjoying the views from the ledges">}}

Then we get to this “ledge”.

{{< rimg src="3.jpg" caption="Is this the Bellygood Ledge?">}}

This is definitely exposed! But would you really call this a ledge? But then
I have no idea where else we could have ended up. Also, there is a bolt to the
right that could be used to set up a belay. Sort of at least; there are no bolts
along the traverse, thus a fall could be far, you would swing into the chimney
to the right (not nice), and then you have to ascend the rope to get back up
(annoying and time consuming). On the positive side: you would not fall to your
death.

Vera decides that traversing this ledge is too scary for her. There is a way to
skip the next two pitches through the ledge system and we decide to do that.
Even though that means skipping one of the most exciting part for me, I do not
want to pressure my partner into this and maybe have to perform complicated
self-rescue operations later on.

Afterwards I will stare at this picture and think that this really looks insane.
We must have been at the wrong spot. But I cannot figure out where we went
wrong. Finally, I come along [this website](http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/britishcolumbia/squamish)
with [this picture](https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5523/14371686245_055cb20607_b.jpg)
on it, confirming it to be the Bellygood Ledge!

To get around the next two pitches, we have to ascend a system of narrow zig-zag
ledges on fixed ropes. It is getting quite exposed and Vera is visibly affected
by that. But now we are already on the ledge system and to get out there are
only two options: continue upwards and finish the route or go the same exposed
ledge system back down to a trail that descends the Chief.

We decide on the second option with the compromise that I get to climb the next
pitch “Universal Key” (5.10b) sport style (e.g. get lowered back down to the
ledge after completing it). According to the guide book, the bolts are oddly
positioned. I do not notice that at first, climb through a first crux, traverse
on a ledge to the right, and then I am stuck. The ledge narrows and turns into
a thin crack turning vertical. The next bolt is to the right.  Laybacking on the
crack I am about two hands short of reaching it. There are no features on the
rock in-between to hold onto. The rock is actually somewhat covered with lichen
and slightly crumbly on touch, suggesting that no one climbed across there.
Neither seems there to be another route leading up to that bolt. With that bolt
seeming out of question, I consider going directly up. But the crack feature is
getting very shallow and turning into a slight overhang with a far reach to the
top of the wall. It seems too far for me (but is apparently the right way as
a hidden sentence in the guide book implies that I find later). I decide I lack
the motivation to risk a fall there because we are bailing anyways. Might as
well bail from that spot even though it means I have to leave a cheap quick link
as bail biner there (later I realize I might have left one either way because on
a multipitch there might be no rappel rings on the anchors if it is not a rappel
spot). Before coming down, I still take in the view.

After going back down the zig-zag ledges, we meet a trail that goes back around
the Chief with some slabby parts protected with fixed lines until we hit the
official hiking trail going up the Chief.

{{< rimg src="14.jpg" caption="Our escape route">}}

We take a short break and then decide to go take up the hiking trail to the
First Peak (the lowest of three) to have at least been on top.

{{< rimg src="5.jpg" caption="Ther chipmunks know, where there are tourists, there will be food">}}

We then head back down to meet Christine and Tim who did another (shorter and
not all the way up) traditionally protected multipitch climb on the Apron of the
Chief. Given that we bailed it is still early enough to have another shower at
the recreation centre and eat a delicious Pizza at Joe Pesto's. Surprisingly, we
see our campsite neighbours there again.

While we did not climb all of Stairway to Heaven, it was still a success, in the
sense that we returned in good health. That is the most important thing after
all. I might give the route another try in the future if I get the opportunity.
Though, I am not necessarily looking forward to have to climb the runout slab
pitches again. I also will need a partner who can handle the exposure better,
maybe even thrives a little bit on it like me.

On a side note, the color of my climbing shoes started rubbing off and colored
my toes quite orange. They still looked orange after the shower. At least the
shoes have broken in and are a bit more comfortable, but I am starting to get
different pain points from the prolonged use.
