Like yesterday, it is supposed to be dry in the morning, but start to rain in
the afternoon. We decide to go back to the Gosau lake where we were two days
ago. But instead of taking the gondola up, we do the Laserer Alpin via ferrata
directly at the lake.

It is just a short 15 minute walk from the bus stop. The first part of the via
ferrata runs barely above the water surface. The topo showed shark fins in the
lake, but luckily we do not see any sharks.

Then a rope ladder follows and the via ferrata circles back to the start above
the hiking trail along the lake's shore.

Close to the end, we have to cross a rope bridge above the hiking trail. A few
hikers are quite impressed.

After having completed the Laserer Alpin via ferrata within about an hour, we
take the bus a couple of stops North to continue with the Gosauschmied via
ferrata. It is actually not just a single via ferrata, but more like a park with
multiple via ferratas that can be mixed and matched. We start with the first
part of the original Schmied via ferrata, but use variations of the start. My
parents do a B/C ramp, while I do the D/E variant called “kurz und heftig”
(“short and very hard”). While there are many steel rungs, it is indeed not to
be underestimated. The shoes are still a bit slippery from the mud directly
below the rock face, the wall is a bit overhanging, and it is at least 15 meters
of climbing until it gets easier. The very thin and rusty steel cable used as
protection does not inspire confidence either, and adds to the mental challenge.

After the first part, we continue in the Max via ferrata and than “Espresso”
with a few difficult D spots.

Then we continue on the Schmied via ferrata from the beginning. It is now
easier, but many parts are in the forest and somewhat wet. We have to be careful
to not slip on the wet rocks. There is also another rope bridge to cross before
the end. We then take off our harnesses and walk a short bit to discover that it
was not the actual end but it follows another short part called “Draufgabe”
(“encore”). The topo did not show that there is a unsecured walking part
in-between. Even though it is easy, we put the harnesses back on to be safe on
the slippery, wet rock.

After a bit less than two hours and 130m of elevation, we can finally
descent. It takes us about an hour and shortly before we reach the bus stop, it
finally starts to rain. We eat in a nearby restaurant to avoid waiting in the
rain.
