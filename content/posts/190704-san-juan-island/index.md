Today we could not sleep quite as long because we wanted to make it to the 4th
of July parade in Friday Harbor. Lots of people are watching the various floats
go by. Fittingly, we see a bald eagle fly above at some point. I suppose it does
not get much more American than this.

However, we do not see any of Susie's mopeds in the parade. These rentals are
a quite common occurence on the island and sometimes a traffic disturbance due
to their slow speed.

Next we go tide pooling.

A highlight of the day is going sailing on David's sailboat.

But the visit to Friday Harbor labs (where Peter's mum Megan just became interim
director), is quite interesting too.

Here is a video of a scale worm feeding. Watch until the end!

In the evening, we watch the 4th of July fireworks. Originally, we wanted to
drive down to Friday Harbor for this, but were misinformed about the time they
start. Thus, we end up not having enough time and would have missed the
fireworks on the drive. Instead we watch them from the deck, where we are not as
close, but can also see the fireworks in Roche Harbor and on Lopez Island which
gives us quite the show.

This was the last day we spent on San Juan Island. Tomorrow we will leave for
other exciting adventures. Here is a nice panorama of the interior of the house
we stayed the last few days in.
