It's a long weekend for Fabian and me (next Tuesday is a holiday, so it is four
free days with just one vacation day). We have some climbing tours planned in
the Zillertal in Austria. First, we take the train to Jenbach where we change to
a much smaller train that takes us to Mayrhofen in the Zillertal. From there, we
continue a bit further by bus before we start our hike up to the Berliner Hütte
(2042m), where we will spend our night.

We reach the hut in the early afternoon after about 2:30h of hiking and a lunch
break in-between. Nevertheless, it was a quite strenuous ascent of 1200m
elevation (and 475m of descent) given the heat and heavy climbing equipment. I'm
carrying the rope today and my pack weighs in at a total of about 16kg (of which
about 4.5 to 5kg are the rope, and 2.5kg are water).

At the hut, we first refresh ourselves with some more or less isotonic drinks and
have a relaxed and lazy afternoon. The interior of the hut is quite
impressive for a mountain hut with a spacious and neatly decorated dining hall.
For dinner we enjoy roast beef and then go to bed as we are planning an
early start the next day.
