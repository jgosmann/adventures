It is Mother's day and a rich breakfast is offered including a Mother's day cake
and Prosecco. Unfortunately, I find out afterwards that my rear tire is still
losing air. At least it is not as much as before, so I decide to just top up
the air. The weather is supposed to be dry this morning but might get rainy
again in the afternoon. Thus, I want to make as much distance as early as
possible. As I only noticed this morning that I am still losing air, it should
last me at least for the first half of day. While I also lubricate my chain, I
have a short chat with an interested older person.

After another short climb, I get alternating fun downhill rides and climbs back
up. All with a great view of the surrounding mountains and valley leading up to
the Brenner.

In Pfons, I pass a suspension bridge where I make a short stop to walk onto it
and enjoy the view of the gorge below from high above.

To avoid 4km of a busy road, I take a detour from the official route. While
figuring out where exactly this detour branches off, a middle-aged man on an
e-bike with touring luggage passes me and turns left. A moment later a younger
man on a gravel bike without luggage turns up and shouts “Hans, rightward!”, but
obviously is not heard and stops next to me to wait for Hans to return. I will
see these two a few more times over the day. Hans always in front and the other
one a bit behind.

The detour takes me up an additional, somewhat steep climb on a gravel road. But
I also get some nice views. Often the highway bridges going up to the Brenner on
the other side of the valley are visible. Not really untouched nature, but
I cannot deny that these are impressive structures. After the climb, it goes
downhill again before finally hitting the road up to the Brenner. The guidebook
described it as a quite bumpy ride (and mountain bike trail). But I find that it
is just a normal gravel road, not even with particular many pot holes, and way
less bumpy than some of the paths around lake Sylvenstein on the first day. The
very final part of the downhill part was quite steep, though. But with shifting
my weight a little-bit backwards (think very basic mountain bike riding
technique) I got down safely.

better condition, i.e. not bumpy at all."

Now I am standing at the point where the final climb up the Brenner follows and
I have to ride on the road with normal traffic. But beforehand I eat an energy
bar to be sure to make it up there. While there is some traffic, it does not turn
out to be that bad and the climb, while certainly being effort, is also not as
bad expected. Definitely much more manageable than the part just after
Innsbruck.

And then I am suddenly standing at the highest point of today at 1370m above sea
level. This marks also the point where I cross the border from Austria to Italy.

While crossing into Italy, I get hit by a shower, but it is over quickly. On the
Italian side I can finally leave the road and follow an old train track that has
been converted to a car-free cycle path. I pass a bench and table soon where
I have a proper lunch break.

Rolling down the old train track is quite enjoyable. On some parts I have quite
strong headwinds, but rolling downhill these do not pose a problem. Every now
and then the trail passes through a tunnel and there are quite a few ruins of
old station buildings and the like to be found along the way. The views are
amazing too and I pass through a few really beautiful small villages.

I am happy to find another tool station outside of a bicycle shop directly on my
route. While it is closed on Sundays, it does have a compressor accessible that
I can use to give my leaky tire a convenient top up.

Not long after, I make it to Sterzing with its beautiful city core.

As I leave Sterzing, dark clouds accumulate on the mountains behind me and I get
hit by another short, but somewhat heavy shower. Soon the weather is nice again.
Even somewhat sunny and much better than expected. Actually perfect cycling
weather: dry and not too warm.

While the route has been really enjoyable since I entered Italy, it also was not
long before I hit the first part closed due to construction. Now I hit the
second closed part. Luckily in each case the detour is pretty short.

Shortly before the fortress Franzensfeste, I leave the main route towards Brixen
(in German, Bressanone in Italian). It brings me about 200m down into a
valley that I will have to climb back up again tomorrow. But it turns out to be
very well worth it because the city and valley are so beautiful.

As I approach the city center I hear noise that hints at some sort of major
event going on. The noise is getting closer and the I suddenly directly pass the
source: the finals of a European Boulder Cup are ongoing and the entry is free.
That is in awesome coincidence! As I still have time, a lock up my bike and
watch the rest of the event.

Then I check in at the Youth Hostel in the city center where I booked a single
room. It is a nice building and room, only the elevator is incredibly slow.
I only use it to avoid carrying my panniers up, otherwise I use the stairs.

After having checked in, I stroll through the beautiful city core and have
dinner in a South Tyrolean restaurant, sitting outside, enjoying the warm
evening. I have South Tyrolean Gröstl: fried potatoes with boiled beef fillet
and onions. Quite tasty! Afterwards I explore the city a bit more on this nice
evening.

Today I travelled 89.4km in 5:13h. With 55.4km/h I reached the top speed of the
whole vacation, though my average speed was only 17.7km/h as I had to climb up
the Brenner.
