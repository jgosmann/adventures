This weekend, I am doing a solo overnight trip with a stay in a tiny mountain
hut (Breitenkopfhütte). By splitting the tour over two days, I do not have to
start super early and can take a train around 9am. Unfortunately, at this time
it is quite crowded and I do not get a seat for most of the ride. When I arrive
in Ehrwald, I have to wait a bit for the bus, which brings me to the starting
point at the station of a gondola. I could take it up, but chose walk because
I have enough time. I follow a wider path that is also used by quite a few
mountain bikers. It leads mostly through nice forest and the gondola quickly
disappears behind trees.

As I get close to the summit station, the view opens up to the Mieminger
mountains. I think I can already spot where the mountain hut has to be. In front
of it seems to be still quite some snow leftover from the winter. Hopefully this
won't be a problem! At least I'm carrying my ice pick with me.

I pass the busy Alp near the gondola's summit station and turn towards the Igelsee
(“hedgehog lake”). It is quite idyllic here.

At the Igelsee, the approach trail to the Breitenkopfhütte branches off.
Suddenly, it is much less busy. One person comes the other way and some trail
runner will catch up with me later, but that will be the last person I see
today. At the start of the approach trail is a shed, where one can pick up some
firewood to carry it up to the hut.

Eventually I get closer to the hut. In front is a steep snow field. But with my
ice pick for extra support and balance it is no problem. The snow consistency is
quite good. Soft enough to kick in steps, but hard enough too carry my weight.

To the hut at 2020m, I ascended 926m in 2 hours and 40 minutes. At the hut
I unload my backpack and make sure that I know where the essential things are.
In particular, I locate the spring about 150 meters below the hut and then
search for the toilet which should be 50 meters left of the hut. I'm just not
sure whether they mean left of the hut when you stand in front of it or left of
the hut when it is in your back. It takes me probably about an hour to actually
locate the toilet. Turns out it is still deep below the snow field and I won't
be able to reach it safely.

I considered to ascent the Breitenkopf today, but now it is already a bit late,
there is a chance of thunderstorms and there are gray clouds. As I'm not sure
that the weather will stay dry, I postpone that plan to tomorrow. Instead, I try
to get a fire going in the oven. In theory it is simple, but in practice it
takes me three tries before I finally get one of the big logs burning. After
that it still takes quite long until I I have some water boiling, but then I can
finally prepare the freeze-dried potato stew trekking meal, that I carried up,
and enjoy a warm dinner. The fire also warms the hut itself a little bit.

After dinner I read until sunset and then go to bed.
