We have another rest day. That means we sleep in, have a relaxed breakfast on
our terrace, walk to the water station to refill our water supplies, write post
cards, watch the men's semifinal of the world cup in Salt Lake City, do laundry,
get some ice cream, visit the beach, and finally visit the yoga drop-in class at
the Kalymnos Experience. Afterwards we are lazy and also have dinner right
there.
