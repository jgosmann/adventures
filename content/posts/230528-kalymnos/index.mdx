Today, we start climbing at Arginonta. But before, we take a group picture
(excluding Jonas) in our TNG apparel because we four work for TNG. Later we share
it with all the other climbing enthusiasts in the company.

The approach requires us to climb a short via ferrata.

I warm up on Papou <Grade value="5c+" system="french" />, but keep drifting into
the line right to it because to me it appears as the logical line. After another,
harder, warm up, Jonas recommends to me Romance of Stone <Grade value="6c+"
system="french" />. It starts with somewhat hard tufa climbing and then gets
easy. Surprisingly, I manage to onsight it, which makes it my hardest onsight to
date.

Now the crag is getting sunny and we switch locations to the nearby Arginonta
Valley. Given that <Link to="/posts/230523-kalymnos/">I figured out all the
moves on Massive Attack <Grade value="7c" system="french" /></Link>, I try it
again. But after four or five goes, I am too tired and leave it for another
time. Given the tiredness, I just do on more route: In Vino Veritas <Grade
valeu="6b" system="french" />.

We have dinner at La Kambusa, an Italian restaurant. Their pizza is actually
pretty good and be recommended! We also enjoy Aperol Spritz and Tiramisu.
