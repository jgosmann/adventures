Not quite as sunny as yesterday, but still dry, we decide to climb at the
Bergkristall (“mountain crystal”) crag today. It is just a bit deeper into the
valley where we are staying.

At the beginning we have a little bit trouble correlating the bolt lines with
the routes in the guide. The picture printed in it is taken from an awkward
angle. Eventually, I get on a route that we think should be one of the <Grade
system="french" value="5b" /> routes. It is an enjoyable and technical slab for
the most part, but it feels a bit hard for the grade. Right before the anchor it
gets even trickier and harder and I barely manage to avoid falling. Back on the
ground, we figure out that I did “Ohne Seil?“ (“Without rope?”), a <Grade
system="french" value="6b" />.

After another warm-up, I get on Wurschtl <Grade system="french" value="6b+" />.
However, it has a hard crux with few and tiny crimps above a ledge. The bolt
distance is also a bit far and I'm not sure that I will not hit the ledge,
should I fall. I climb twice into the crux, but are afraid to commit and
down climb each time to a rest spot. Eventually, I decide that it is not worth
the risk and down climb the route.

Next I try the even harder route Hart gewesen (“It's been hard“) <Grade
system="french" value="6c+" />. It has much denser bolting, especially around
the crux at the beginning, which makes it feel much safer. And, I sit in the
rope a lot, until I manage to get up on crimps varying from good to barely even
there. All of them are slanted in one direction. This alone wouldn't be
a problem, but the feet are the same crimps, slanted in the same direction,
making it impossible to build up counter-pressure between the hands and feet.
After that crimpy part, an easier slab follows which isn't any more fun. It is
dirty and has quite some vegetation, though with a nice smell of thyme. But the
worst still awaits me. For some reason the anchor is above a ledge with some
really easy climbing, not really adding anything of importance to the route.
Except that the ledge that has to be crossed is completely muddy!

In the meantime, Alex put up draws on Adrenalinjunkie <Grade system="french"
value="6c+" />. The grade of this route is determined by essentially a single
move where you have to stand up from under an overhang onto a high foot at the
start of a more slabby section. In the beginning you still have some crimps, but
at the end of that move you have barely anything to hold onto. It takes me quite
a while to figure out the exact movement on my first try in the route. But two
tries later I can send it.

To end the day, I climb two more easy routes. Sporthängen (“sport
hanging”) <Grade system="french" value="6a" /> is mentally more challenging than
expected because it is a bit runout and many bolt hangers are not normed and
thus not completely trustworthy (though at the actual crux spots there are
perfectly solid glue bolts). There are also quite a few slabby spots covered in
pine needles where you have to be careful to not slip on those needles and a
corner that takes some effort.

The last route, Olli <Grade system="french" value="5a" /> is technically a two
pitch route, where I free solo the first <Grade system="french" value="3" />
pitch on rather flat terrain. The bolting is also a bit strange because the
second pitch is way off to the left and it seems much more sensible to use one
of the routes to the left as the first pitch.

For dinner, we have left overs from the previous days and some greek salad.
Unfortunately, Antoine has got sick with a cold and fever this afternoon or
evening and stays in bed.
