Today's weather forecast expects a high of 34°C in the valley, but surprisingly
very little risk of thunderstorms. Given such stable weather, I have planned
a quite long tour crossing over the Ehrwalder Sonnenspitze. Unfortunately,
I only make it to Garmisch-Partenkirchen before my connecting train gets
cancelled on short notice. Given the length of the tour, waiting an hour for the
next train, isn't a good option. Thus, I decide to do some hiking
near Garmisch. Luckily, the Wetterstein mountains in the South of Garmisch are
still included in the map I packed for today. One option might be to summit the

<Link to="/posts/210807-hoher-gaif/">Hohe Gaif</Link> once more.

Ideally, I could take the train of the Zugspitzbahn to get closer to the area,
but there are so many people trying to take it that I would have to wait for
an hour here too. There is also a bus going the same direction, but I just missed
it. So the only sensible option is to start the hike right here in Garmisch.

Soon I'm ascending the mountains on rather broad trails through the woods, but
at least with very few people. Hidden in the woods, I come along a historic bob
racing track. After the Kreuzjoch (1719m), I have a lunch break. Then I reach
the Kreuzeck-Haus where the quiet trails end. A cable car is going up to here
and there are some rather wide trails connecting it to another cable car station
on the Osterfelderkopf.

Soon, I'm at the Hochalm and notice that I didn't want to end up here. I missed
a branching point and have to go back a bit to get onto the Bernadeinsteig.
Back when I summitet the Hohe Gaif the first time, I hiked this trail in the
other direction. It is actually quite nice. At least until it takes a right
behind the Bernadeinwände and starts to go uphill; quickly leaving the shade of
trees. Even though it doesn't have the 34°C of the valley at this elevation, it
is quite humid. I feel like I'm sweating waterfalls and despite drinking a lot,
the heat is taking its toll on me. I have to stop every now and then for a short
break (which I'm not used to) and force myself to continue. The last few meters
of elevation are high enough for not even mountain pine to grow there anymore.
Before entering this area, I take shelter in the little shade of one such
mountain pines for a while. I feel like laying down and
sleeping, but eventually need to continue.

Finally, I am at the Stuibensee. From here, the trail to the Hohe Gaif would
branch off. But I decide to forgo this summit given my exhaustion, having some
pain below the backside of my knee today, and the hour of the day. If I were to
summit it, I would certainly miss the last cable car down. Descending by foot
would take even longer and it would get really late. Thus, I continue to the
Bernadeinkopf (2143m), my highest summit today, which is almost on my way.

After another break, I take the via ferrata (A/B) through the north face of the
Alpsitze to the cable car station on the Osterfelderkopf. Despite having done
multiple tours in this area, I never went along this particular via ferrata. Now
going downhill and with some climbing-like movement, the hike is suddenly much
more fun. Part of the trail goes through some dark tunnels. Good thing I have
a headlamp with me.

At the Osterfelderkopf cable car station, I get
a [Radler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandy#Radler). The isotonic mix of
sugar, minerals, and liquid does wonders and I feel much better. Also, it is
getting increasingly more cloudy, a bit more windy, and the heat becomes less
intense. After finishing my drink, I just missed the cable car down that would
have allowed me to catch the next train of the Zugspitzbahn back and the next
train is scheduled in an hour. Given these factors, I decide to save my money
and descend by foot.

I am pretty quick and make it down to Hammersbach in about 90 minutes. I don't
see many people. Most probably took the cable car. The trails are also quite
nice here. Right at the end of the trail head is a restaurant that also sells
take-away ice cream. I think, I earned one and eat it on a nearby swinging
bench. Until I suddenly see a few other hikers starting to run into the
direction of the train station. Apparently, the Zugspitzbahn runs extra trains,
not listed in the schedule, in the evening to manage all the tourists going
home. I don't think long and sprint into the same direction still catching the
train. This gives me some time to buy the last available, but well needed,
isotonic sports drink at the Garmisch-Partenkirchen train station, before
catching a train earlier than I expected, that is also a faster connection back
to Munich. That makes up at least a little bit for cancelled train this morning.

Due to heat, the hike left me quite tired. About 26km and 7:15h of hiking,
ascending about 1890m, and descending about 1810m did their part too of course.
