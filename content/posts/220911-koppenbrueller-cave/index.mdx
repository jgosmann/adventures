While we had at least some dry hours each day, today it will rain more or less
for the whole day. We decide to visit the Koppenbrüller cave. We manage to be
there for the first offered tour of the day. It turns out to be a private tour
because we are the first to appear that early. It is quite interesting, covering
geology, the research done in the cave, the ways water makes it way into and out
of the cave, and more.

Afterwards, we spent some time in a café to pass the time until the next train.
Parts are decorated like the interior of an old train and there is all sorts of
stuff around. It is not always quite clear what is just decoration and what is
actually for sale.

Back in Bad Ischl, we attend another tour through a beer cellar that was driven
into the rock itself. On the way back to our holiday flat, we pass the villa of
the composer Franz Lehár.
