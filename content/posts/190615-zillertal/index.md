Last weekend a couple of friends from bouldering and I (we were eight in total)
went to the Zillertal for a weekend.

{{< loc "47.3855478" "11.8470404" >}}

Leaving Munich with two cars right after work around 5pm on Friday, we arrive
close to 7pm at the holiday home that we rented for the weekend. After getting
a little bit comfortable, most of the group goes to eat dinner at some
restaurant, while Fabian, Lisa, and I either ate beforehand or brought some
dinner. Once we're finished we have a little bit of a walk through the village
to the Ziller, the river flowing through the Zillertal. On the way back, we meet
the rest of the group who has finished dinner and also went for a walk.

After returning home we go to bed as the plan is to wake up early to make most
of the next day. Unfortunately, the weather is supposed to turn wet later in the
day.

Saturday morning we eat breakfast, pack our bouldering things, and then drive to
a place where we pick up two giant rented crash pads. It takes us a little bit
to figure out how to fit them together with all people into the cars. Once the
problem is solved (for now) we drive to the Zemmschlucht, but it turns out the
water levels are too high to reach any boulders (which apparently are in the
river bed). So we go on to the next spot close by. Unfortunately, not with any
more luck because those couple of boulders were removed due to some
construction. We then continue to Zillergrund Wald (where we should have gone
directly). After dropping us and the crash pads, Lisa has to leave for a while
to pick up Jason from Mayerhofen. He just came back from abroad and will also
join us for the rest of the weekend. In the meantime we search for the boulders,
but only really find one. There we climb Motscho (supposedly 6c Fb bloc, but it
seems easier) and then play around a bit with variations.

 While Motscho traverses a bit form the left before going up, we come up with
a line that goes directly up and isn't in the guide book. I am the first to send
the line. Maybe a first ascent? If so, I decide to call it Alter Falter and
think its grade is around actual V4/6c Fb bloc (but definitely harder than
Motscho). The crux is definitely the first move and it is pretty much a one move
wonder.

 After Lisa and Jason return, they quickly warm up on the same boulder and then
we go on a little bit further into the forest where there are much more
boulders. There I do a nice traverse (unknown name, 5c Fb trav) and Pablo Diablo
(5a Fb bloc) which is not easy (also harder than Motscho) and takes a while to
figure out, but once you do the moves come together quite nicely. We try a few
more problems, but I am only able to send two other easy problems not listed in
the guide book.

A couple of times we had a few drops of rain already, but now there is a little
shower that wets non-overhanging boulders and we decide that we are spent for
the day anyways. So we stash the crash pads in the cars, take a short walk, and
drive back to our holiday home. The evening is spent with cooking dinner and
playing a couple of rounds of the board game Codenames.
