Despite a beautiful April, the weather has been pretty cold and wet for most of
May. But this weekend was finally a little bit nicer and, together with Jason
and Lisa, I got around to check out the “Chinesische Mauer” (Chinese Great Wall)
crag near Leutasch in Austria. It is pretty impressive as you can see from the
title picture.

We warmed up on Take It Easy (<Grade system="french" value="5c" />), which was quite stiff,
then continued with Der Gipfelschilling (<Grade system="french" value="6b+" />) which
was even stiffer (and I did not send it). We ended the day with L'Lisa (<Grade system="french" value="6c" />) because of the name. I did not send that one
either, but at least it felt possible and maybe having an accurate grade.
