Twice a year my employer invites all employees to a five-star superior hotel in
the middle of the Alps.

Of the two days we stay there, one is regarded as leisure time and a whole range
of activities is offered. I decided to join a hike with some colleagues onto the
Seefeldspitze.

On the day of the hike, we gain most of the elevation with a cable car and
gondola. Unfortunately, the trail we orginally intended to take is still closed
due to snow cover (even though it is an incredibly hot day). Thus, we have to
take an alternative shorter trail that leaves us plenty time for breaks.

Despite long breaks and a meal at a hut, we still have plenty of time and decide
to walk all the way back down instead of taking the cable again. Afterwards we
get picked up by a bus that brings us back to Munich. Due to heavy traffic we
take a different route along the Walchensee. I already saw it from the top of
the {{< refPost "190126-simetsberg" >}}Simetsberg{{</refPost>}} in winter, but it is quite
beatiful in summer.

All in all this was a nice warm-up for my vacation starting the next day with an
early flight around 8am.
