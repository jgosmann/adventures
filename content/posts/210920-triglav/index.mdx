While the previous hut only offered bread with jam, honey etc. for breakfast, we
get, in addition, the choice of different meal options today. I have pancakes. Not
the thick American ones, but thin, Crêpe like European ones with jam. They (and
the tea) are tasty but extremely sweet, so that we forego the extra jam on the
bread.

When we start hiking, it is still a bit raining, but soon stops
and the sky clears up to beautiful weather. From the Vršiču pass we descend into
the Soča valley. It is a fairly easy trail, but again we do not see any other
people. Instead we find a fire salamander. We also enjoy some amazing views of
the mountain landscape without any visible human buildings. It reminds me a bit
of the wilderness in Canada or the USA.

The descent brings us close to the Soča spring. We make the small detour to
there. Surprisingly, the last bit is secured with a steel cable and you have to
be careful on the somewhat wet rock to not fall from a ledge onto the rocks
below. This little protection would be unthinkable in Germany at such a popular
tourist spot. Luckily, we are still quite early and can enjoy the mesmerizing
blue of the source alone.

We then follow the Soča downstream through the valley. It is one of the wildest
remaining untouched mountain rivers in the Alps. The blue water flowing through
the bright rocks in quite beautiful.

A little detour up from the river, we pass the Kugy memorial. Julius Kugy was an
early mountaineer in the Julian Alps on the search for a mythical flower. We are
a bit surprised, that this memorial has a “summit” log.

The Soča valley is also known for its small suspension bridges, of which pass
a couple. They swing quite a bit up and down when walking over them.

Eventually, we reach Trenta, where we, sadly, have to leave the Soča. From here,
a long ascent (about 1600m) awaits us to the Zasavska koča na Prehodavcih
hut. During the ascent it gets cloudier, but it stays dry.

Eventually, we reach the hut (after a total of 7h walking with 1180m descent and
then 1625m ascent). It is much more basic than our previous huts. There is no
potable water at the hut (except for bottled water that is sold there). To wash
yourself, there is one faucet close to ground outside of the hut. The toilets are
an actual outhouse with pit toilets. The hut itself consisted essentially of one
dining room downstairs and two sleeping rooms.

When we arrive, a few day guests are still around, but leave soon. This night, it
is only us and two guys from the Netherlands staying at the hut. We chat
a little bit about where we came from and heading to while we enjoy the views
around. For dinner we only have the choice between two meals (Goulash which we
already had recently) and bell peppers with a meat-rice filling. We decide for
the latter.
