Today is our last day of the vacation. We won't climb another mountain today,
but just descent to Vent and travel back to Munich. This allows us to
finally sleep a bit longer, have breakfast at an (almost) humane time of 7am,
and pack everything up without haste.

It turns out that sheep also like to use our trail. They block it on multiple
occasions. But when walking towards them with enough confidence, they flee onto
the grassy slopes and let us through.

Before hitting the wider and more populated trails in the valley, we have
a relaxed break.

On the remainder of the trail we pass a waterfall, and cross a suspension
bridge.

The descent of 830m took us 2:20h. We timed it well and only have to wait 10
minutes for the bus, and another couple of minutes for our connection in Sölden.
At the Ötztal train station we have to wait, however, almost an hour which we
spend in a nearby green space. The train is pretty full once again, but this
time we do not get kicked out and even get seats at the Innsbruck stop. In
Kufstein we change trains once more and are soon back in Munich after a quite
adventurous extended weekend.
