On probably the last really warm and sunny weekend of the year, I take the train
to Scharnitz with my bicycle. From there, I ride up a gravel path to the Isar
source. The views are nice and some leaves are already turning golden.

At the source, I lock up my bike, and walk the last few meters by foot. It is
fascinating how the water suddenly emerges from the ground in several spots and
very quickly creates a sizeable stream. Even though, I'm already 12km in into my
cycling tour, one could consider this the true beginning of the journey as now
I will follow the river all the way back to Munich.

Riding downhill from the source towards Scharnitz is a joy. Then it is a bit
flatter towards Mittenwald. From Mittenwald <Link
to="/posts/210508-isarradweg/">I did this tour before</Link>, and even tough,
I left the most beautiful part behind me, it still stays a fantastic
landscape. Close to Wallgau, 45km in, I have a short break before continuing to
Vorderriß.

From Vorderriß to the Sylvensteinspeicher, it gets a bit less nice, having to
ride on a road with a lot of motorcycle traffic. Past that it is again quite
enjoyable. A bit short of 90km (between Lenggries and Bad Tölz), I have second
short break.

Now, I starting to feel a bit tired. The cycling path no longer follows directly
the Isar and weirs off into a somewhat hilly region with some steeper inclines
that I forgot about and just remember now. But I push through. Close to 130km
I have a bit longer break for a drink and snack at an inn on the way near
Wolfratshausen. This gives me some new energy. Also it is now 5:30pm, and the
sun is less intense. I make a good speed on the remaining stretch to Munich,
where I arrive at 7pm. This makes today my longest cycle tour ever with 154km,
or if we count getting to the central station in the morning, even 160km!

I was moving for 7 hours, apparently had an elevation gain of 840m (even though
I started around 1100m and went down to 540m). My average speed was 22.2km/h and
I reached a maximum speed of 53.5km/h.
