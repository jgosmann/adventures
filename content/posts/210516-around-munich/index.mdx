Despite the weather forecast saying that there will be some rain today,
Martin, Kristina, Fabian, and I decided to do a bicycle tour around Munich.
We met up at Martin and Kristina's house at 8am and then did a loop around the
outskirts of Munich in counter-clockwise direction.

In the North, we pass through Oberschleißheim with a small palace and garden.
Cycling is not allowed in the palace garden. Even though it is still quite empty
at the early hour, we follow the rules and push our bikes through it to enjoy the
scenery.

Shortly after passing Dachau, we have a second breakfast break at the river
Amper. In the river are birds nesting (I suppose Blässhühner/coots) and we
see one bringing a new twig for the nest.

In Puchheim, we visit Susanne at her home (one of Martin and Kristina's friends
who has joined us in the mountains before). It is a really convenient lunch
break with coffee, tea, cake, and cinnamon rolls on the sunny patio. Even
though it is nice, we have to continue eventually.

In Buchenhain, a Munich bouldering spot in use for over a century (!), we make
a stop to watch the climbers for a little bit. Then, on the other side of the
Isar, awaits us the steepest climb of the day. Otherwise, the route is pretty
flat.

Eventually, we have another break on a bench with a plastic horse toy and a
view of the Alps.

After refueling, it is time for the final push to close the loop. And then, a
few more kilometers to get back home. Surprisingly, we did _not_ have single
drop of rain! We even had a lot of sun (though not always) without it being too
warm. Only after we are all back home it starts to rain a bit.

I cycled today a whopping 143km with the loop being a bit over 130km.
Overall it took about 10.5 hours of which I spent 7 hours and 40 minutes in
motion (mostly cycling, but a bit of walking in Oberschleißheim). Our average
speed was 18.5km/h and our maximum speed 39km/h.
