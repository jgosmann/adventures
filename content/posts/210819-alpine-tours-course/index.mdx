We wake up at 5:45am. Sort of, I was not able to sleep for most of the night and
have been awake already. We eat breakfast at 6am, and then leave for our first
real alpine tour by 7am. The weather is supposed to worsen in the early
afternoon and stay variable over the remainder of the week. Thus, we want to use
the weather window to get in an actual tour (learning by doing) and do more
training when the whether worsens. Also, the snow and ice conditions are better
in the morning. Our goal for today is to ascend the Johannisberg (3453m).

Usually, the rope party would be led by the most experienced person. But to
maximize learning, it is up to us taking turns in leading. I start leading the
day. Our instructor ties in in second place to prevent us from doing anything
horribly wrong.

After a while on the glacier, we have to navigate through the tail of a crevasse
area. But the crevasses are fairly easy to see and narrow enough to cross them
with big steps.

Eventually, we take a short break and swap leads. We also look towards the
mountains and valley behind us. It seems like the bad weather is slowly rolling
in, so we do not waste much time.

A steep ascent later, we make it to the summit. We have two other
mountaineers take a summit group picture of us, and we enjoy the view with the
famous Großglocker and Großvenediger mountains. Yesterday's
worries were unnecessary, all of us feel well. No signs of altitude sickness
whatsoever.

Then we start our descent. Half-way down, the weather looks much better again and
we stop to practice building T-trench anchors in the snow. A (properly) buried
ice pick can hold surprisingly strong forces!

The snow has gotten quite mushy in the sun by now and makes walking much more
strenuous than in the morning. Eventually we reach a part where we have some
actual ice before the final small ascent back to the hut. Here we practice the
second important anchor building technique: ice screws. If you never used an ice
screw, it is actually quite surprising how easy it is to put them into the ice.
It is also much quicker than digging a snow anchor and also very strong. We also
try out the special technique of a V thread or Abalakov anchor. There you drill
(with your ice screw) two holes into the ice that meet and create a V shaped
hourglass. You can thread a cord around that and use it for rappelling.

After about 7:30h we arrive back at the hut and take a break to recover from the
tour with about 635m ascent and descent. A little bit later in the afternoon,
the weather still looking great, we head back out to learn the first crevasse
rescue technique: hauling. First we go through the steps on flat ground, then we
haul actual persons over an edge. We also practice how to react and arrest
yourself when falling on a slope, and how to use the ice pick to create steps in
snow or ice.
