After a late breakfast with bacon and eggs, we take a stroll through Friday
Harbor. We come across Sunken Park which is actually lower than its surroundings
and Peter shows us the school he went to.

The ferry was shut down for most of the day, because someone left a bomb threat
in one of the wash rooms. Luckily, this did not happen yesterday. Of course,
there was no bomb to be found.

After the walk around town, we visit another one of Peter's friends, throw some
Frisbee, go for a swim in Egg Lake, and attend an Ultimate pickup game. Lots of
fun.

The rest of the evening, we spend relaxing on the deck and making big, fat
burgers for dinner.
