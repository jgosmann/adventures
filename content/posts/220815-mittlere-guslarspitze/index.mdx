We wake up before 5am again. This night I already slept a bit better. We have
a quiet breakfast because we are the only ones up so early today. But it is not
raining and we start our tour as planned with the sunrise.

We plan to ascent the Fluchtkogel (3494m), climb along the ridge line, and
circle back to the hut via the Vernagtferner. First, we follow a trail to the
Guslarferner while it is slowly getting brighter.

The interplay of clouds between the mountains, warm sunlight falling onto them,
and ice-blue glacier is incredible. On a perfect whether day we would never have
witnessed anything like this.

Now it is time gear up and cross the glacier. Part of it is quite steep.

As we get closer to the Oberes Guslarjoch, the saddle we have to pass today, we
encounter more and larger crevasses.

The final ascent to the saddle, we cannot do on the ice as the crevasses get too
big and they span the whole width of the gully we're ascending. Instead we have
to climb loose rocks to the side. Another party appears on the top of the
saddle, starting to down climb towards us, but then changes its mind and
disappears the other way again.

On the saddle, we check the weather and time. Unfortunately, it took us longer
than planned to get here. We decide that, with the forecast thunderstorm, we
won't have sufficient time anymore to climb the Fluchtkogel. However, while
climbing up on those loose rocks in the gully was doable, going down on them
seems a lot less safe. No wonder, that the other group turned around. We still
see them crossing the large glacier on the other side of the saddle. Thus, we
take a look at the map and determine that we can also cross that glacier towards
the Brandenburger Haus, turn around and circle back to the Vernagthütte. The
glacier in front of us is also nowhere near as steep and thus has less crevasses
which will allow us to travel much faster than going the same way back (even
though the total distance is more).

As we pass over the glacier, we get engulfed in clouds. This makes navigation
a little bit harder, but we remain with a general sense of direction and have
a GPS unit to help us.

After about 4:30h since our start, we leave the glacier and have a first
longer break, now that we are on slightly safer ground concerning changes in the
weather. Next, we follow an incredibly well marked trail through the fog (it
seems they put all of the missing trail markings from yesterday here).

Eventually, we reach another decision point. While it is quite cloudy, it does
not look like a thunderstorm is going to happen soon. Thus, we decide to cross
over the Mittlere Guslarspitze (3128m) to have at least done one summit today,
even though it won't be our highest point today. That was the saddle point
Oberes Guslarjoch (3366m). From the summit, we get a good view of this morning's
ascent whenever there are some gaps between the clouds. Since our last break
about 1:30h has passed.

During the descent back to our hut, we get some more good views of the
surrounding mountains and glaciers.

After another hour, we are back the hut, well before it rains a bit in the
afternoon (with very little thunder). We did around 1000m of elevation today.
First, we relax a little bit on the hut's porch. Later we have hot chocolate
(and I also order a soup with
[Knödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del)). Martin and Kristina take
a nap for the remaining afternoon, while Fabian and I browse some magazines and
books lying around in the hut for such relaxed, rainy afternoons.

Today, dinner consists of tomato soup,
[schnitzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnitzel) with potato salad, and
fruit salad. After a subsequent round of
[Wizard](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(card_game)>) we end up in bed
again, even though we can sleep a bit longer tomorrow.
