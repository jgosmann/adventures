My parents visit over the Easter weekend. We spend the Good Friday hiking in the
Mangfall valley.

We start at the terminal stop of one of the S-Bahn connections. From there it takes
about 30 minutes to get to the Mangfall river. On the way, we pass a group
preparing a ride with camels. Not quite what one would expect in the middle of
Bavaria.

After a short loop through Kleinhöhenkirchen, we follow the Mangfall southwards.

Around lunchtime we stop at the Maxlmühle to have some drinks and a piece of
cake. A cat gets cozy in a chair next to us.

Afterwards we continue a little bit further before turning around at a large
highway bridge and following the same trail back.

We walked more than 18.6km today within about 5 hours (excluding the breaks). We
ascended about 350m.
