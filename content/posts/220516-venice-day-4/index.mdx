Today is the last day of my vacation and to use it to the fullest, I wake up an
hour earlier than usual. At the breakfast, I meet an older American who is
telling me about his travels through Europe that he could finally realize after
the Covid lock downs.

As I cross the bridge to Venice, I notice that the tide is really low today and
exposes an algae covered ground that was hidden before.

To avoid buying another vaporetto ticket, I walk to the Piazza San Marco where
I booked a ticket for the earliest entry at 9 am to the Palazzo Ducale. At first
there are also a few guided groups, but after I let them pass, it was not too
crowded.

After the palace rooms, you cross over the Bridge of Sighs into the jail.

After I'm finished with the Palazzo Ducale, I also visit the Museo Corror
because it is included in the entrance fee. However, I do not have that much time
left and do not look at many things in there in detail. Much of it is also not
that interesting to me.

Then, around noon, it is time to walk back to my bicycle. On the way, I grab
a panino for lunch. In a pasticceria I grab a cornelli for desert (that was too
sweet for my taste) and something similar to a chocolate croissant for the train
ride back (that was quite good).

For some reason, I booked the train back to Munich not from Venice, but Mestre,
so I have to ride back over the bridge one more time. Presumably, I thought
I would spend the last day visiting the Museo del '900/M9 in Mestre and did not
realize that it is closed on Mondays.

Boarding the train is a little bit stressful because I don't know where the
bicycle carriage will stop and after getting the bike on the train, I need to
board myself with my luggage before it departs. But it works out fine. The train
ride itself is quite relaxed. Between Brixen and Innsbruck the train tracks
follow the Munich-Venice bicycle route quite closely. It is nice to see these
parts once again and recapitulate the experiences of about a week ago.

Back in Munich, I have to cycle a few more kilometers and then I am at home. Of
course, it is raining until I arrive at home, so that I have to get all of my
rain gear out once more. Was this really necessary?

Today I cycled a total of 25.3km within 1:11h, averaging 21.3km/h and achieving
a maximum speed of 31.9km/h. The total distance travelled by bicycle in this
vacation was 756.9km.

I already noted that the cycling tour part of the vacation was quite amazing,
but the Venice part was quite nice too. There is definitely a lot too see in
this unique city. You can also enjoy great food in Venice, though it is not
cheap. While there are many tourists, I think I managed quite well to avoid the
worst of it.
