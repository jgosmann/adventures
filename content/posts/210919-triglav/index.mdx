Today, the weather forecast is even worse than yesterday. Thus, we decide
against the originally planned long and difficult crossing of the Jalovec
(2645m). Instead, we use the alternative, direct route to the Tičarjev dom na
Vršiču hut, where we will stay the next night.

Because it is only an extra 100m of elevation, we pass over the Slemenova špica
summit (1911m). So far, we stayed dry despite the fog.

Almost up to the summit, we did not meet anyone else. On the summit, it is
a bit busier with people who ascended from Vršič, the pass where we have to
descent to. There are a few other Germans and a group of US Americans with
a mountain guide.

During the descent we have a little bit of rain, but stay mostly dry.

Due to the short route (only 2:30h walking time, 860m elevation gain, 400m
elevation loss), we are already at the hut in the early afternoon and have to
kill a lot of time. We eat more traditional Slovenian meals: barley soup,
Carniolan sausage with sauerkraut, and [Žganci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDganci).
The other guests at the hut are quite international as it is conveniently
reachable by car on a road that leads to the popular Soča valley.
