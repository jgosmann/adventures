Wen have a relaxed breakfast before we start our hike to Gaisalp lakes. Soon we
follow a nice mountain stream up to the lower lake.

We want to continue along the trail to the upper lake. But we don't check the
map carefully and end up on the trail to the summit of the Rubihorn (1957m).
Instead of turning around, we decide to continue and have a lunch break on the
summit.

From here, Martin and Kristina descent with Jonas on the same way to the lower
Gaisalp lake, whereas Fabian and I traverse the ridge line across the Gaisalpfuß
and Geißfus before descending to the upper Gaisalp lake, that is still surrounded
by a lot of snow.

We continue to the lower lake where we meet with Martin and
Kristina. Together we descend the same way we hiked up, but take a slight detour
across the Gaisalp, where we have some delicious buttermilk with apricot syrup.

Again, the evening is spent with cooking (Gnocci with spinach and tomatoes) and
debating the tour for the next day. Originally the weather looked like it would
be best tomorrow. But now it is forecast to be less stable. Thus, we
defer the final decision to the next morning.
