After a pretty rainy July, the summer is finally back. Vroni and I decided to
repeat <Link to="/posts/210807-hoher-gaif/">a tour that I did four years
ago</Link> (almost to the day): the Mauerläufer via ferrata and afterwards the
Hohe Gaif (2288m).

<Loc latlong={[47.42233, 11.06338]} />

We take the gondola up to the Osterfelderkopf. From there it is short hike
downwards to the start of the via ferrata. I have the feeling that it takes
a bit more power today than the last time. Or maybe it is my sleep deficit.
Unfortunately, I almost haven't slept at all last night due to the heat. Today
is going to be quite warm again with temperatures up to 30°C in the valley. But
at least the via ferrata is in the shade. We still make a good time and finish
it in about 50 minutes, catching up with two other parties in the end.

At the summit of the Bernadeinkopf (2143m), we have a short lunch break. Then we
descent to the Stuibensee, a small mountain lake, from where the ascent to the
Hohe Gaif starts.

The ascent towards the ridge line is quite steep, and it drains my
energy. At the ridge line, the actual climbing up to <Grade system="UIAA"
value="2" /> starts. My legs still feel a bit weak from the ascent. While I'm
still focussed and calm in the critical passages, I'm also mentally affected and
feel a bit anxious. Halfway along the ridge line, being prompted by Vroni if I'm
alright, I admit that it might be better to stop here as it is not worth the
risk (especially as I have been on the summit before).

I sit down, eat a granola bar, and enjoy the impressive view of the Reintal,
while Vroni continues the last 15 minutes to the summit alone. A bit calmer,
w e descent to the Stuibensee from where we don't got back to the
Osterfelderkopf, but to the slightly farther Kreuzeck, where another gondola can
take us down. For the last part we have to ascent a little bit again, and I feel
again how drained I am. At the Kreuzeck summit station, I need a moment to
recover myself, while Vroni gets some Radler and cake for us to celebrate the
end of a tiresome, but still nice tour. I suppose, admitting defeat can also be
an important lesson, and as the saying goes “experience is what you get when you
didn't get what you wanted”.
