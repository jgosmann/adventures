It is Marco's birthday and he planned a birthday hike to the Feichteck (1514m).
We crawl up as a group of about 30 people. Half-way up and on the summit, Marco
stashed drinks the day before. He also prepared a lot of food that we are
carrying up to the summit.

To make it a bit more interesting, there is a book to win, if you are the one to
identify the most persons from a provided list. For example, one person to find
was someone who has been more than a 100 times on the Zugspitze summit. There is
also a bottle of whiskey hidden along the way that we manage to find with some
hints provided as a poem.

The hiking without breaks took about 2:30h and involved about 600m of elevation
difference.
