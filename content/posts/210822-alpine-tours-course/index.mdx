It is departure day and everyone seems to be slightly tired. We have trouble
deciding whether to climb the Mittlere Bärenkopf (“bear head in the middle”,
3358m) as a final quick summit before leaving. Eventually we put it to the vote.
I am in favour of climbing it because I am not feeling that tired and the
opportunity should be seized. Beatrice (who also seems to be on the fitter side
and did a <Link to="/posts/200731-zugspitze/">Zugspitz crossing like me</Link>)
joins me. Finally, Christian comes around too and we have reached critical mass.
Only Kira decides to stay back at the hut for a relaxed morning.

On the way, we have to cross a short glacier patch. There are some crevasses (it
is where we practiced some of the crevasse rescue), so we rope up, but we do not
need crampons.

As we ascend the mountain, clouds roll in with fascinating movement. They become
increasingly thicker and more foggy. We even get hit by a few light drops of
rain.

The final stretch before the summit is again a somewhat exposed ridge.

Due to the weather, we do not spend much time on the summit and descend again.
On the way back on the ridge, the clouds suddenly clear up and we get an amazing
view. The climb was worth it just for this magical moment alone!

Back at the hut, we have a lunch break. The short tour took about 2:30h with
a ascent and descent of about 420m. After lunch, it is sadly time to descend
back to the Kaiser Franz-Josef-Höhe. But not before a final group picture.

Of course we have to descent the via ferrata from the first day again, and cross
the small patch of glacier. There are now quite a few small streams in it,
shimmering in a nice blue color.

Back at the Kaise Franz-Josef Höhe, the vibe is completely different than on
the first day. The place is swarming with tourists and we are seemingly the only
alpinists there. We say final good-byes and separate for the drive back to
Munich.

All in all it was a great five days. We had incredible luck with the weather,
learned a lot, and could summit three proper mountains. All participants were
fairly fit, which helped. I also liked that it was not a completely risk free and
boring environment (as you might expect from a course), but we climbed
mountains where you actually had to be a bit careful on the ridge lines.
