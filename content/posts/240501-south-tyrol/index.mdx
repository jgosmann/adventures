Today the weather is supposed to turn rainy again around noon. But that still
leaves a few hours to climb. Jonas, Anna, and I go back to Stuls. Anja,
unfortunately, also got sick over night. Alex and Steffi have other plans.

In the beginning, the weather is sunnier than expected. We warm up on Offnhitz

<Grade system="french" value="6a" />. It has a nice corner and gets surprisingly
difficult right before the anchor, making it a hard onsight.

Next is Gipfelstürmer (“summiteer”) <Grade system="french" value="6a" />.
A really great route that offers everything from a corner through slabs to
overhangs. The quality of the routes here in Stuls is quite amazing!

Despite the weather forecast, today is the first day we are joined by other
climbers at the crag. Nevertheless, I don't dare to get on anything hard like
Linksverkehr <Grade system="french" value="6c" /> from <Link
to="/posts/240429-south-tyrol/">two days ago</Link> because I don't want to get
stuck on it when it starts raining.

A few more easy routes later, I get on Benny <Grade system="french" value="6b+"
/>, my hardest route today (see the video below for the crux sections). I send
it on my second try. Then while we discuss whether we want to do a final route,
the first rain drops begin to fall and make the decision for us. It is 3pm and
we were able to climb for much longer than expected.

We walk back to Stuls and celebrate one more day of excellent climbing with
a cake at the place we went two days ago to already. I have
[Sachertorte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachertorte) this time and it comes
with a quite impressive decoration. Of course, we also get some cake to take
away for those staying at home.

For dinner, I prepare [a tasty Chana Masala](https://www.thecuriouschickpea.com/restaurant-style-chana-masala/).
Unfortunately, Jonas is getting sick now too. But as the next days are supposed
to be rainy, it might be good timing.

<Nextday />
