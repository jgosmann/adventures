The night was rainy and cold, but when we wake up the weather is again beatiful.
After breakfast (oatmeal) and packing up the gear, we are back on the trail. The
underbrush is still wet from the rain and both Peter and Alex get wet feet from
the water shed by just walking through, but my hiking boots are still pretty
new and the Gore-Tex holds up.

On a few hours into the hike, two dogs suddenly appear running downhill
towards us. Shortly after followed by a friendly hiker with whom we have
a short chat while throwing sticks for the dogs to catch. Those dogs seem to
have way to much energy.

A bit later we pass a wooden shelter.

The vegetation is surprisingly varied and often changes every few meters
depending on the direction of the slope and amount of nearby water streams. One
side of a ridge can be rocky and desert-like to immediatly turn into green
grassland on the other side of the ridge. It is interesting how the composition
of plants changes the closer you get to a stream to than change in the opposite
order once you cross the stream.

We pass one suitable camping spot, but to be on the safe side for the upcoming
two days, we decide again to press on to the next spot. It is, however, quite
a distance away as the map tells us. The terrain will be too steep to pitch
a tent, yet alone sleep in it, for the next several kilometers. But the
elevation lines tell us that there should be a flatter area a bit short of
crossing the next ridge line.

After descending into a valley and climbing up most of the ridge line again, we
finally make it close to the spot we determined on the map. Unfortunately, we
are not the first there and meet other campers with a bunch of goats that they
apparently use to carry their gear. So we go a bit off-trail and find another
secluded spot in the area with a way better view. We are only a little bit
worried about a large amount of bear scat nearby. We hang our food far from the
tent this night.

Today was a long day. It took us 10:20h to hike the 24.5km with 1136m of ascent
and 1222m descent. Our peak elevation was 2264m.
