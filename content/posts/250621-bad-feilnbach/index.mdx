I haven't gotten far from Kochel, and I stand in front of a barricaded bridge
that cannot be crossed. No signage for a detour. Thus, I have to figure out an
alternate route myself. I hit dead ends two or three times, but eventually make it
back onto the official route.

Towards Bad Tölz, the route goes along a larger street, which is not that
enjoyable. But Bad Tölz is pretty. This is also the point where I cross the
Isar and the <Link to="/posts/220506-muenchen-venedig-day-1/">Munich-Venezia
route</Link>. Here, I buy some tasty cheese, and also get my general shopping
done.

I continue via the beautiful Tegernsee and Schliersee. It is still hot and I'm
still having headwinds. At the Schliersee I cool off in the lake. I think it is
the first time that I'm at the Schliersee in the summer. So far I remember only
ever visiting it for winter snow shoe tours.

Towards Bad Feilnbach, I get a long descent, where I manage to reach a speed of
62.6km/h. This might be my record on a bicycle. A bit after Bad Feilnbach I stay
at a guesthouse for the night.

Today's distance was 105km with an average speed of 18.1km/h. It took me 5:45h
of cycling. I am now looking forward to a more relaxed day tomorrow. When I check
the route for tomorrow, I realize that I did change my plans, but forgot to
update my estimate for the distance. It turns out, tomorrow I will have to cover
at least 130km. That is unfortunately very much not relaxed.
