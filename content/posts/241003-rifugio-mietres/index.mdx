The weather forecast isn't good for today. While it is still dry in the morning,
it is supposed to start raining soon. The most recent forecast from this morning
is even a bit worse than yesterday evening's forecast. Originally, we considered
doing the via ferratas Sentiero dei Canyons e delle Cascate Fanes. These have
parts behind waterfalls that will be wet anyways. But with the updated weather
forecast, we decide against it and start a hike to the Rifugio Miètres.

We start the hike early and it is still dry. In the
outskirts of Cortina, we take a wrong turn, but it doesn't really matter as the
paths join later again at an old, unused ski lift.

Shortly before the Rifugio Miètres, and 1:20h into the hike, the first light
rain starts. On the patio of the rifugio we are protected from the rain and put
on rain jackets. The rifugio itself is already closed at this time of year.

We continue in the light rain to Rio Gere. It turns out to be a big parking lot
for ski tourists. The description in the guide book is no longer accurate and we
are a bit lost here. For a while we don't know where to continue, but then
figure out that we have to follow the road for a while and soon there is also
a proper hiking trail next to the road. Eventually, we turn away from the
road. Through the fog and increasingly more rain, we circle back to Cortina.

After 4:10h, we reach home and can dry our wet clothes. We covered an elevation
difference of 620m. Luckily, most of the ascent happened before it started
raining, so that we didn't sweat too much in our rain gear.
