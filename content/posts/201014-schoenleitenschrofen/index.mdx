Deterred from the somewhat cold and snowy conditions at altitude yesterday,
we decide against attempting the Tegelbergsteig. Instead we do another, not
too difficult hike, around the Tegelberg area to the Schönleitenschrofen.

Today, we start directly at the Tegelbergbahn valley station and hike on the same
trail as yesterday for the first part. But soon, we branch off to the left,
following a wide logging road with some narrower shortcuts in-between. After
a while, we reach a steep, narrow trail branching off that takes us out into the
warm morning sun onto the Hornburg (1172m). From there we get a quite beautiful
view onto the famous Neuschwanstein castle. I think having the mountains as
backdrop makes this an even better scenery than the supposedly “ultimate view”
from the Marienbrücke we had yesterday.

We enjoy the view and sun for while, and then, backtrack to the logging road
that we follow to the Rohrkopfhütte, a hut where we have coffee and hot
chocolate.

While this first part of the hike was somewhat busy with hikers, the next
section to the Drehhütte gets a little bit less busy.

After the Drehhütte, we finally leave the beaten tracks completely and we see
few other hikers for the rest of the tour. Though, in the next section we meet
a group of mountain bikers that are pushing down their bikes our narrow and
steep hiking trail. Obviously, they didn't quite pick the best route for their
activity. Our next intermediate goal is the Vordermühlberger Älpele.

Now we ascend another couple hundred meters on a wide trail, traverse a bit more
on a much narrower trail, and reach the Schönleitenschrofen (1702m).

After a break, we backtrace our steps a bit again and traverse to the Tegelberg
in the opposite direction. Twice, we have to descend quite a bit just to ascend
again.

After the final descend and ascend we reach the Tegelberg from where we want to
take the gondola down. Unfortunately, it is the time when everyone wants to get
down, so we have to wait a long time in a line. While the temperatures were
comfortable while moving and taking short breaks, we get quite cold waiting that
long. Apparently the temperature was a meager —2°C with some wind chill.

Nevertheless, a nice hike that took us about 5:15h (excluding breaks). We
ascended 1440m and descended 515m.
