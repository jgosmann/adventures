Today, the weather is much more cloudy and even a bit rainy at times. The ideal
day for museum visits. I start with the Sisi Museum about the Austrian Empress.
It seems like a must-see in Vienna, though it is a bit of a sellout. The
exhibition is interesting as I am not that familiar with the hype around Sisi,
tough I visited <Link to="/posts/220910-rettenbach-wilderness/">her summer
residence</Link> before. The palace rooms are pretty much the same as in any
other palace in my opinion. Only the gymnastic equipment of Sisi is an
interesting, unconventional touch. Apart from that, it is also quite annoying
that large, guided tourists groups are squeezing through and at times
I literally end up stuck in such groups.

After exiting the Sisi Museum, I visit the Vienna Museum about the history of
the city from the early settlements until today's age. It is quite elaborate,
interesting, and well made. Thus, I end up staying for the remainder of the day
until the museum closes at 6pm and still haven't been able to look at everything
in depth. If I were staying in Vienna for longer, I could have come another time
as the entrance is free.

After leaving the museum, I get a Pok√© bowl for dinner. I consider visiting the
House of Music, a museum open late until 10pm. But then decide against it
because I'm a bit tired and not sure if I still have the energy to make it worth
the entrance fee.
