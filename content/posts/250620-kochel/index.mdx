Today, I will have to make some distance. I leave at 8:30am in the hope to still
get some cooler morning hours, but I can already feel the intensity of the sun.
At least, climbing up the hill that I came down yesterday does not turn out as
bad as I feared.

Not far in, I have the option to take a detour to some castle remains of Burg
Eisenberg and Hohenfreyberg on a hill. I'm not sure what I was thinking, but
I go for it. Getting up there is quite steep and tiring. After catching my
breath I have to walk the last meters. At least I am rewarded with a great view.

I continue towards Füssen. In the outskirts I pass a grocery story directly
en-route. I grab some things to eat there. After Füssen, I pass the famous
fairytale castle Neuschwanstein. A bit farther, I find a nicely shaded bench with
view of the landscape and the castle. There, I stop for a lunch break. I manage
to eat the whole 500g pot of potato salad that I bought and some more. These
hills are burning some calories!

The worst of the hills still awaits me. And not just that, but, now in the
afternoon, the wind gets really strong again and is mostly coming from the front.
I decided to do the tour from west to east because this should be the
predominant wind direction (at least I thought), but apparently I got unlucky.
The heat doesn't help either and so I slowly crawl up the ascents, but also
enjoy some downhills and the landscape.

Along the route I pass the Wieskirche, a pilgrimage church. I take a look inside
and enjoy the cool air inside.

In Bad Kohlgrub, I stop once more at a restaurant to order a Radler and a light
meal. I'm indeed hungry again. I need more calories. Afterwards, it rolls more
easily. It is now later in the afternoon, so the heat is less intense. Also,
I get now longer, not quite as steep, descent rides. The last part is fairly
flat and eventually I reach the next campsite at Lake Kochel around 6pm.

Same procedure as yesterday: pitch the tent, cook some pasta, go for a swim in
the lake, and shower.

Today's distance was 119km with an average speed of 18.8km/h. It took me 6:20h,
and I reached a maximum speed of 56.9km/h.
