We get breakfast at a caf√© and then wait for the guy of the car rental place to
show up.

After acquiring a rental car we shuttle people and luggage to Masouri, the
climber's village on the island, in two loads. The village appears to consist, by
one third each, out of restaurants, climbing shops, and accommodation.

Having dropped off our luggage at the vacation home where we stay for the
remainder of the trip, we drive to Arhi to start climbing. There we also meet
Silvia, a friend of Anja and Jonas. It is sunny, but not too hot given the wind
and occasional cloud.

Nevertheless, we eventually decide to move over to Summertime, a crag on the
opposite side of the bay which is now in the shade. After the first few
warm-ups, I try a slightly harder route with Maccabi <Grade value="6b+"
system="french" />. It has a tricky crux and I take a fall the first time, but
then send it second go by going quite a bit left in the crux.

We end the day with dinner at Kokkinidis with a few more people that Anja and
Jonas know, but it is their last day on Kalymnos.
