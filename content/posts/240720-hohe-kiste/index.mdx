Fabian and I want to summit the Hohe Kisten (“high boxes”, 1922m) today via some
older, no longer maintained trails. Starting from Eschenlohe, we soon leave the
wide, well-known trails, to turn onto a narrow and steep trails through the
woods. Despite not being maintained, we are not completely alone and overtake
a couple of other hikers. In one spot, we have to carefully cross the area of
a small landslide. It wasn't a recent one, so the ground is quite solid, but
steep with a little bit of gravel on top. Not a real problem for us though.
Eventually, we reach the Kistenkar where we leave the forested area and have to
ascend on some scree.

A few rain drops start falling, but not enough to make things slippery or to
require rain jackets. On the scree, we catch up with another hiking group,
apparently a family. Finally, there are a few easy climbing moves on solid rock
and we are back on an official trail that brings us to the summit in another to
fifteen minutes. Now, the rain drops stopped and it is starting to get sunnier.

After a break, we follow the official trail along the ridge line southward, but
turn onto the Martinisteig before reaching the Krottenkopf. This trail is also
unmaintnained. It is even more narrow than our ascent trail and quite grassy.
But the danger to fall is low. Any slip would be quickly stopped by barriers of
mountain pines growing around us. Below the tree line, we pass the Teufelskapelle
(“devil's chapel”) where we have another break. It is a rock formation that
looks like a church, especially with the summit cross, on its rock needle
forming the church tower.

Not much longer, and we're back on a wide gravel road that brings us back to our
starting point. In-between we make another break to better time our arrival with
the departure of the train back. Without breaks it took as a bit less than
6 hours. We ascended (and descended) about 1540m of elevation.
