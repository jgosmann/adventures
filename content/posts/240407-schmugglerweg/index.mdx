Today, we do an easy hike around the area. Every now and then we come along
a sign pointing out a short cut. We find it a bit funny that ‚Äúshort cut‚Äù is in
bold font and the destination that the short cut leads to only in small print.
It is only a short cut if it actually leads to the desired destination!
Because the short cuts are on narrower trails, we usually take them.

clearly see how it was deposited in layers and then deformed."

After a while, we reach the pilgrimage church Streichen where we have a short
break to enjoy the views.

We then continue with our loop through some forest. At some point we miss our
trail branching off and have to backtrack a bit the path, we're on, suddenly ends.
Through some nice landscapes we reach the pilgrimage church of Klobenstein.
There is an inn where we have lunch (I have Spinatkn√∂del, dumplings with
spinach).

Full from lunch, we spend some time at the beach at the Tiroler Ache, the stream
going through this valley. We put our feet a bit into the water, but it is quite
cold. After half a minute it becomes painful enough to get the feet back out.
We then continue across a suspension bridge to the other river bank and climb up
to a viewpoint.

From here, we continue on a path that was used by smugglers back in the day.
Soon we cross back into Germany from Austria. Shortly before we reach the start
of our hike, we get back to the shore of the Tiroler Ache. There we have another
break and put our feet into the water once more. I go actually all in because
I didn't want to have carried my swimming pants for nothing. üòâ But I cannot
stay long because it is still extremely cold, though also quite refreshing with
today's heat.

Finally, we have to cross a stream flowing into the Tiroler Ache. Everyone has
their own technique for crossing from jumping from stone to stone to taking of
the shoes and wading through the cold water.

After about 4 hours and 14.5km of hiking and 600m ascended and descended, we
complete the loop and a great weekend comes to an end. Almost. As our train is
delayed in Rosenheim, we still have time to enjoy an ice cream together.
