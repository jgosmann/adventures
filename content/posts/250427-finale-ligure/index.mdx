We get breakfast at a place at the lakeside. From our seats we can watch a large
number of ducklings with their mother.

After the very relaxed start into the day, we take another stroll at the lake
shore. Anna, Anja, and I eventually decide to go for a quick swim. The water
turns out to be quite cold (not fully unexpectedly). Once we are dry again,
almost at noon, we continue our drive to Finale Ligure.

In the late afternoon, we arrive at our vacation home in Calice Ligure, just
a bit North of Finale Ligure. From the terrace, we have a quite nice view over
Calice. After unloading the car, we take a stroll through the village and get an
ice cream at the local gelato place. It is really good!

We then search for a place to have dinner at. Standing in front of one
restaurant, a local, older woman addresses us in German and recommends to us
another restaurant down the street, which is apparently the established place
that she always goes to. We eventually follow the recommendation. I have ravioli
and Tiramisu and I am not disappointed.
