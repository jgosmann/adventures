This morning it is still raining a little bit occasionally. So we still cannot
do a via ferrata. Instead, we do a tour of Telfs. There are many fountains with
religious figures, two churches, and art installations related to the Shrove
Tuesday tradition in Telfs.

In the afternoon, we wanted to check out the local climbing gym. But the weather
cleared up a little bit, so we decide spontaneously to take a risk and do a via
ferrata. Yesterday, we had the Leite Klettersteig near Nassereith in mind, but
we dump that plan and decide for the Crazy Eddy via ferrata instead. It has
a descent path halfway and the hardest spots right at the start of the first and
second part. This is preferable with the unstable weather. If it starts to rain
again before we start either of the parts we can retreat safely; if starts to
rain while we are in one of the parts, we have a high chance of having passed
the difficult section already and only need to finish the easier part in the
rain. It lies also behind an additional line of mountains, making it more likely
that all of the rain comes down before passing over to us.

While we walk to the train station to get to the via ferrata in Silz, we get hit
by another shower. On the approach from the train station in Silz to the via
ferrata we get hit by some more rain drops, but then it stays dry and even a bit
sunny. We take the harder (difficulty D) of two starts to the via ferrata. It is
nice, not too easy climbing.

The second part of the via ferrata starts with a unique feature: two spider webs
out of chains. They climb a bit like a rope ladder. Afterwards a corner follows,
which is also a bit challenging due to the distance of the steel rungs.

The via ferrata is completed with a two rope bridge. The ropes are quite far
apart which can be a problem for short people. My mum was quite afraid that
she might not be able to cross it. But in the end she made it without problems.

After the completion of the via ferrata, we have some Radler (beer mixed with
lemonade) and wheat beer in the namesake Crazy Eddy restaurant. Without approach
and descent, the via ferrata took us about 1:30h. It had an ascent of 150m and
with the approach together we ascended 280m.
