I visited the EuroRust conference in Brussels this year. Now I am spending the
consecutive weekend with some sightseeing here.

Already on Wednesday evening, when I arrived, I took a quick stroll through the
city center after getting some famous Belgian fries for dinner.

Today, I am visiting the Comic Strip Museum. On the way I pass the Mannekin Pis
once more, today dressed up. The museum shows a bit the history of comics in
general and works of Belgian and European artists.

The afternoon I spend at the iconic Atomium. You can walk through a couple of
the spheres. They contain a small exhibition about the history of the Atomium
and world fair. Two spheres are dedicated to an audio-visual art installation.
Finally, you can get a nice view over the city from the top sphere.

The entry to the Atomium also included the nearby Design Museum, thus I visited
it as well. The main collection is focused on plastic furniture (chairs, tables,
...). Given that is was “free” is was decently interesting, but otherwise
I wouldn't recommend it if things made from plastic are not your primary
interest.

To end the day, I had dinner at a small Indian place “Spoonful of India”, which
had excellent food. Just be careful with the level of spicyness that you order.
The low to medium was quite borderline for me.
