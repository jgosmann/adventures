Today we take a train and then a bus deep into the Ötztal. Because the mountains
here are covered with a lot of trees, it is sometimes referred to as “Little
Canada”. Indeed it has a little bit similarity with the mountains in western
Canada.

Our goal for today is the Lehner Wasserfall (Lehner waterfall) via ferrata. From
where the bus drops us off it is a short hike. Then we cross the stream created
by the waterfall on a narrow foot bridge, a few steps later we are at the actual
somewhat steep start (C).

After the starting wall, it gets easier for a while.

We also get a great view of the waterfall now.

But also a great view of the Ötztal.

The via ferrata is easy enough here to eat an energy bar while still moving
along.

Then we have to traverse a slab, but with lots of artificial steps to make it
easy.

After passing around the corner of the slab part, the waterfall gets back into
our view and is much closer now. This is also where the via ferrata splits into
three variants. Two variants go up right here. One is easy (B), the other one is
a short overhang rated D/E. The third variant traverses right to the waterfall
and goes up a long overhanging stretch next to it, also rated D/E, but much
more difficult due to the shear length.

My mum decides for the short D/E overhang is over it before I can pull out my
phone and take a picture.

I decide for the long D/E overhang. It has many artificial steel rungs which
give you many good hand and foot holds, but due to the length some
endurance is definitely required. I make it through without resting, but I am
breathing heavily. Being that close to the waterfall is pretty cool though!

Afterwards all variants join together for an impressive finale with a rope
bridge right in front of the waterfall.

After finishing the via ferrata and descending back down, we have to walk quite
a bit to get to the village with some restaurants to have lunch. The via ferrata
took us 2:30h and we ascended 320m.

Being fed, we have some time to waste before the next bus back departs. We find
some boulders and a slackline in a nearby park and the time passes quickly.

Back at our holiday flat we relax on the rooftop patio, enjoy the evening sun,
and plan for the next day.
