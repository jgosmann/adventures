It has been a couple of months since my last real outdoor adventure. This is
mainly due to the second lockdown in Germany, but partially also because my
bicycle got run over by a stupid truck driver (he did see me, he had a red
light, and he decided to go for it anyways üò°, at least I was not injured üòÆ‚Äçüí®).
Due to the whole Corona situation, wait times for new bicycles are extra long
and I have been waiting on a replacement since beginning of November. But now
it finally arrived and with it changed the weather from Canadian winter like
(temperatures far below ‚Äî10¬∞C) to nice spring weather with up to 15¬∞C. Ideal
for a test ride.

I start late, shortly after 11am, to give the sun a bit more time to warm
everything up (the nights are still somewhat cold). After leaving the city
towards the East, I take the Northern leg of my route first by accident instead
of the Southern one as intended. But I do not notice it yet and it might be even
better. The Northern leg goes through way more towns and along larger roads
whereas the Southern part has the nicer landscapes. That way I get the less nice
part quickly out of the way. One stretch, even though declared as bicycle route,
is even directly on a larger, somewhat frequented road, without any sort of
bicycle path. Not exactly what I expected following official bicycle routes.

In Forstinning, I turn left, towards the North and start wondering where the big
forest is that I should have come through and should now lie to my left. With a
short inspection of Google Maps on my phone I realize that I ended up on the
Northern leg of my tour. Well, that is not a big problem. I just have to
backtrack a little bit and can then enter the Ebersberger Forst (‚ÄúEbersberg
forest‚Äú). Done with the first 30km, it is time for a lunch break in there.

The paths in the forest turn out to be quite muddy, my speed halves, and my
bicycle starts to get dirtier and dirtier. Somewhere along the way, I cross one
of Bavaria's most important sights with a whopping two out of five stars rating
on Google: the longest straight forest road in Bavaria. Apparently it is 10km
long.

On the other side of the forest, I reach my actual destination at the border of
Ebersberg: an observation tower on a hill. Unfortunately, it is still closed
(the insurance company doesn't like people up there while the temperatures can
still drop below freezing) and while it would be easy to bypass the barrier,
I refrain from it because many families with children are around. But from the
base I get at least a nice view towards the Alps.

After another break, I continue my ride and pass lake a that is still covered in
ice, before entering the forest again. That means more muddy paths and more
layers of dirt piling on onto my new bike. The forest is followed by some
grassland that isn't any less muddy. But beyond some more lakes, most of the
roads are paved again.

The total distance of this tour was 73.6km and took me about 5 hours. Of those
I spend 3 hours and 50 minutes pedalling which makes an average speed of
19.3km/h. I reached a maximum speed of almost 40km/h. And this is what my bike
now looks like, I suppose a cleaning is in order:
