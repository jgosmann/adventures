We take again a gondola, today to the First. As everything is advertised as “Top
of something” here, this is “Top of Adventure”, and there are zip lines and
similar attractions providing a bit of a theme park soundscape for parts of the
day.

But we aren't interested in those attractions. Instead we want to summit the
Scharzhorn (2927m). At first, it is a hike through some grassland, before getting
steeper and more rocky. Once we hit the top of the ridge line, we follow a via
ferrata along to the summit. The views are great.

After a break on the summit, we descent on an alternate route that again
requires a bit of hands in a few spots. For part of it, through a scree field,
there isn't really a trail. But eventually we hit the approach trail again. We
follow it only shortly, before we turn the other way and hike along the
so-called marmot trail towards the Große Scheidegg. From there, we will take the
bus back down to Grindelwald, but it is scheduled only once every hour. So we
don't have time to lose in order to catch the next bus and don't spot any
marmots. Nevertheless, we get some more beautiful views of a bit different
landscape than earlier today. At the bus stop, we even manage to have a quick
drink.

Today's tour took about 5:15h, we ascended 870m and descended 1080m.
