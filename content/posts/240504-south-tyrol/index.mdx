Jonas and Antoine are still sick with fever, and Anja is also still not
completely fit. Even if the fever will go away soon, it will likely be a couple
of days before they can (or should) climb again. Thus, we make the decision to
cancel the trip with a heavy heart. We can still cancel the vacation home for
the second week without cost. Only the hotel tonight in-between can no longer be
fully cancelled.

We come up with the plan that all the sick people (Jonas, Antoine, Anja) and
Anna will drive home after breakfast, while Alex, Steffi, their baby and me will
make use of the hotel night and drive back tomorrow. So we say our good byes and
then my group is on its way farther South to the crag Tisner Auen.

We can park basically park next to the crag with practically no approach. The
rock here is porhyry, which is somewhat rare at least for climbing crags in Alps.
From far it looks like blocks with perfectly smooth faces. The climbing here are
technical slabs and corners, but also long vertical cracks. It is quite fun for
me.

I'm especially excited by the cracks because it is the first time I can
climb proper cracks outdoors. Good thing I practised this at least a little bit
in the gyms. I can make good use of a variety of techniques like hand jams,
finger locks, lay-backing and so on. Figuring out how to combine them to adjust
for varying features of the cracks is great fun.

Among other routes, Alex gets onto Black Flag <Grade system="french" value="6c"
/> which had a cool picture in the guide book. Unfortunately, he takes the wrong
turn at a branching point and gets into an <Grade system="french" value="8a" />
route. While it looks cool, it is way too hard. He has to down climb it when
he realizes his mistake before finishing on the correct route. I try it
afterwards and manage to flash it. All the way I have the feeling that this
isn't that hard yet and the crux must yet to be come. But then I'm at the top.
In particular, the initial crimpy slab section wasn't as bad as expected. In the
middle there was one weird move, where you have to move from one side of
a slanted arête to the other side. It seems like once you move around to the
other side, you should loose all your grip. But when I finally gathered the
courage to commit to it, it surprisingly held.

After this day of great climbing, it is just a short drive to our hotel an
Terlano. To get our money's worth, we take a swim in the hotel pool despite the
cold water (but the weather is decently warm).

We let the day fade with dinner on the terrace of a nearby restaurant. We happen
to order pizza again.
