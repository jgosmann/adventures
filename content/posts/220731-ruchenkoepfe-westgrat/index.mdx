This Sunday, Fabian and I decided to do the West ridge (Westgrat) of the
Ruchenköpfe (1805m). The weather was mostly cloudy and we even had a few drops
of rain, but for a climbing route on a ridge and partially South facing walls,
this were quite decent conditions. Really sunny weather could have been easily
too hot.

<Loc latlong={[47.6481, 11.94726]} />

We start from Geitau and first have to manage the two and a half our approach.
Most of it is a wide, but steep gravel road that we have to carry
the climbing gear and ropes up on.

Most of the climbing route along the west ridge is not harder than <Grade
system="UIAA" value="2+" /> and we initially intended to do those parts without
a rope. However, right at the start one has to get past some smooth rock and our
hiking boots still have some mud stuck on the soles from the approach. This
makes it seem a bit risky and we decide to belay on at least this pitch. After
all we carried the ropes up here already (the crux pitch will be <Grade
system="UIAA" value="4" />), so we might as well use them now. It would be
really stupid to get badly injured despite having the ropes with us.

After having done the first pitch with ropes, we are too lazy to coil them up
again and decide to belay all of the route. This would not really be necessary
and will cost us a lot of time. But we do not have any time pressure and getting
some more alpine belaying practice is also nice.

One spot is quite exposed and I'm doubting whether I am on the right track.
I lose quite a bit more time there looking around for alternative options. But
it turns out I was right all along and the spot is not that hard climbing-wise
if you ignore the exposure.

Shortly after, we make it to the crux pitch with a <Grade system="UIAA" value="4"
/> chimney, though we don't climb it chimney style. Then it is just one
more <Grade system="UIAA" value="3-" /> pitch and we are at the summit. It took
us almost three hours and thus twice as long as stated by the guidebook.

On most summits in the close surroundings, we stood before, but always in
winter: <Link to="/posts/220205-auerspitz/">Auerspitz</Link>, <Link
to="/posts/200111-rotwand/">Rotwand</Link>, <Link

line with the Auerspitz at the right (and all the way to the right the Rotwand
barely made it into the picture).

After a lunch break, we have two options for the descent. We can either walk
down the Schnittlauchrinne (“chive groove”), which does not sound that pleasant,
or rappel down. We decide for the latter option, also to practice rappelling and
because, thanks to our 60m half ropes, we can do it in two rappels instead of
four as given in the guidebook for single ropes.

Then we have to hike back for another two hours to Geitau where we, <Link
to="/posts/220205-auerspitz/">as always at this stop</Link>, just miss a train.
In total, it took us about 9:20h from and back to Geitau with 1000m of elevation
in-between.
