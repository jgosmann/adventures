Today is Saturday and tomorrow most stores will be closed. Thus, I use this
morning to walk to a supermarket in Marghera to buy some more food. On the way,
I also pass a post office (to send some post cards) and a farmer's market. This
shows again that the hotel is in a nice area.

Afterwards, I cycle into the city center of Mestre and visit the Museo del '900
(or M9). I think originally I intended this for my last day before my train
departs in the early afternoon. However, this will be a Monday where the museum
is closed. The museum covers different aspects how Italy changed in the 20th
century with a variety of multimedia-based exhibits. I do not have the time to
look at everything in detail, but get some idea about recent Italian history and
can spent time with all of the most interesting exhibits. It is nice to see
something else in-between all the Venetian churches and art.

After leaving the museum around noon, I have a lunch break on a shady bench
nearby and then cycle to Venice.

In Venice I walk around the Ghetto, where jews were forced to live and the term
“ghetto” even comes from. There is number of synagogues here. Also, the
buildings look a bit different because more people where crammed into a smaller
space.

The remaining afternoon I spend on a kayak tour. It is my first time ever in
a kayak and steering requires some getting used to, but works fine enough after
a while. When going straight, it is possible to get into a quite nice rhythm of
left, right, left, right. The tour allows to get a different look at the
city. For a short stretch we also leave the canals and enter the open sea (well
more the open lagoon) which has a bit more swell, adding some excitement.

I then have dinner in a restaurant with mixed reviews, some saying the food is
just okay and a bit overpriced and others saying it is really good and you
should not believe the negative reviews. It is also mentioned favourably in my
guidebook. Unfortunately, the food is indeed “only” okay.

In a nearby nice park, I spend some more time and plan the next day before
heading back to my hotel. I cycled 21.5km in 1:10h with an average of 18.2km/h
and a maximum speed of 29.4k/h.
