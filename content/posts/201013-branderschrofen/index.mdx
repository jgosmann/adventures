I had a vacation planned in Austria with my parents. Unfortunately, due to the
increasing number of Covid-19 infections there (and everywhere), we changed
plans last minute and spent a couple of days in F√ºssen and some more days in
Munich. We were hoping to do the Tegelbergsteig (<Link
to="/posts/200912-tegelbergsteig">which I did before</Link>) and the Fingersteig
(which I have not done yet). However, the weather has been rainy the last days
and temperatures at altitude are already getting close to the freezing point
this late in October. Thus, we decided to do the easier Gelbe Wand
Steig (‚Äúyellow wall via ferrata‚Äù, difficulty A) and summit the nearby
Branderschrofen to see how the conditions are.

We start our hike near the famous Neuschwanstein castle and walk in about 40
minutes to the Tegelbergbahn (valley station of the gondola). There are buses
directly to the Tegelbergbahn too, but due to the bus schedule this variant is
more convenient for us.

My dad underestimated how warm one gets during hiking (even in flat terrain)
despite the low temperatures and has to take off his long johns. A task that
requires quite a bit of coordination and balance if you are missing a bench to
sit on. It ended with him stepping bare-footed into a cow pie which are a common
occurrence in the meadow of the Alps as there are a lot of cows here.

The last few minutes before reaching the Tegelbergbahn, it begins to rain which
is a bit unexpected. The weather was supposed to be cloudy but dry today. We
check the rain radar and it seems that it won't be long before the rain passes,
so we decide to wait it out under the roof of one of the nearby buildings.
Indeed a short while later the rain stops and we start ascending the
Tegelberg. The fog of the rain clouds creates a special atmosphere.

After a while the hiking trail turns into the Gelbe Wand via ferrata.

The landscape is quite pretty with its thin layer of snow accentuating the rock features.

Despite the wet rock and some snowy patches, the via ferrata is no problem for us
(we all did way harder via ferratas before). We did not even bring our via
ferrata sets to save on weight to carry. It also saves a lot of time if you do
not have to constantly move the carabiners to the next rope segment. Around
lunch, time we approach the Tegelberghaus at 1707m from where we get a nice view
of the Allg√§u and eat a
[Kaspresskn√∂delsuppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_cuisine). This soup,
with a pressed ball of old bread pieces and cheese, is a staple of Alpine cuisine
and warms us for the next part of today's tour.

After the break we continue to summit the Branderschrofen (1879m). The trail
gets increasingly steep and snowy, but is still well within our abilities. We
get an amazing view of the snow covered Alps from the summit.

After enjoying the view for a while it is time to descend back to the
Tegelberghaus on the same path we came up.

The Tegelberg is also a popular spot for paragliders. We observe their
preparations for a while.

The we continue to descend the Tegelberg back to our starting point via a normal
hiking trail (not the via ferrata). It gives us some more great views of the
fall landscape and the castles of the area. Near the end of the trail, we pass a
sign that this trail poses a serious risk to life when it is covered in snow (which is
was at some parts at higher altitude). Well, they should have put that sign at
the other end of the trail where we came from! üòâ But actually, it seems that
they overstate the risk and the sign is probably just there to deter Neuschwanstein
tourists with inappropriate foot wear to wander up too far in the winter.

Shortly before the end of our hike, we have to pass the Marienbr√ºcke. Supposedly,
it gives you the ‚Äúultimate view of the Neuschwanstein castle‚Äù. While it is
a pretty good view, I think there is an even better view that I will tell you
about in the next post. Anyways, on the opposite side of the bridge we passed a
long queue of tourists waiting to get onto the bridge. We were quite astonished
at the number of people waiting in line.

Today's hike was well worth it. To me the change of seasons in the mountains is
one of the most beautiful times. While you are somewhat limited what tours can
be done (not enough snow for snow shoes, but too cold and wet for extremely
demanding tours), you get multiple seasons in a single day as you pass through
the altitudes. The mixture of fall colors in the valleys and wintery mountain
tops is amazing. I had a similar experience last October at the <Link
to="/posts/191003-riffelspitze/">Riffelspitze</Link> and in spring <Link
to="posts/200315-nagelfluhkette/">crossing the Nagelfluhkette</Link>.

The hike took us about 6h to 6:30h (exclusive breaks) and we ascended (and
descended as we did a loop) 1100m.
