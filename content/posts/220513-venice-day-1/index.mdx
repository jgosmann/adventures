After a basic breakfast, I cycle back to Venice. In the hope to avoid the
industrial park, I take an underpass under the train tracks to Mestre and follow
the route given in my guidebook to get from Mestre to Venice. Unfortunately,
this turns out to also go through some industrial area. Even worse, the
construction of another underpass (to get back to the side of the train tracks
where the cycle path over the bridge is located) should have been completed by
now according to the guide book, but it is still pretty much a construction site
and I have to carry my bicycle over some stairs through a still temporary
underpass. (I suppose you cannot expect construction projects to be finished on
time in Italy.) Luckily, I only have light luggage today and my bicycle itself
is also reasonably light.

In Venice is a parking station for bicycles where you can lock up your bicycle
safely in a box. The only downside is that it is quite pricey with €10 for a day.

I then take the vaporetto/waterbus to San Marco. It goes around the boat
terminal where I can watch how parcels are unloaded from trucks onto boats to
then be delivered within Venice. Construction equipment is also transported on
boats.

In San Marco I start a walk through the quarter and immediately pass the most
important tourist attractions: The Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri) over
which prisoners where brought to jail from the law courts, the Piazza San Marco,
Palazzo Ducale, and Basilica di San Marco. It is quite busy here with tourists,
but apparently it is still few tourists for Venice as I can get through quite
easily.

I then continue through San Marco. The main tourist routes are busy, but if you
turn into some of the narrow side streets, it can suddenly be quite quiet. In
the touristy areas are many shops on a spectrum of selling the same cheap
garbage that you get in all tourist hot spots of the world, over shops with more
or less artful masks, to local artists shops with real gems (figuratively). Many
shops also sell all sorts of things made out of glass as glassblowing has a long
history in the city.

Around lunch time, I have a break in a café where I eat a panino. Afterwards
I get some ice cream. As long as you have money, you won't starve in Venice.
There is an abundance of cafés, osterias, trattorias, restaurants, pasticcerias,
ice cream shops, and more.

After making it through San Marco, I cross the Rialto bridge to the Rialto
market and walk through that quarter. Supposedly, the bridge is so packed with
tourists in high season that you cannot even step on it, but at this time I had
not trouble crossing it and even get some photographs of the view from it.

A major part of the afternoon I spend in the Peggy Guggenheim collection
exhibiting many important modern artist such as Max Ernst, Wassily Kandinsky,
Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Andy Warhol, Alexander Calder, etc. Besides the
permanent exhibit, they have a temporary exhibit on surrealism that was quite
informative (I like it if a museum gives you some background and context on the
works), and a lovely courtyard with sculptures.

Afterwards, as I'm already here, I look around a bit more in the quarter of
Dorsoduro and take a look into Santa Maria della Salute, one of the slightly
more important ones of the many churches, containing paintings by Titian like so
many other churches in the city.

For dinner I get some Cicchetti and wine. Cicchetti are small snacks, often
slices of baguette with a variety of topings, that are typical Venetian food.
I then spend some time planning out the next days which isn't easy because it is
a multi-dimensional optimization problem trying to get all the different
constraints satisfied.

Now, in the evening, even though there are still many tourists around, it starts
to get noticeably less busy because many (like me) visit only for the day and do
not stay in Venice where accommodation is much more pricey. Thus, I make another
stop at the Piazza San Marco which is also less busy now. But with the golden
evening light reflecting on the gold mosaics of the Basilica, it is even nicer.

I then cycle back to the hotel with decent speed as I have a slight tailwind on
the bridge. In total I cycled 22.5km today which took me 1:12h giving an average
of 18.7km/h. My maximum speed was 34.8km/h.
