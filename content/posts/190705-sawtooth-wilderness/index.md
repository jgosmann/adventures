We wake up early before sunrise to catch the first ferry to the mainland because
we will have a lot of driving to do. Peter, Alex, and me are planning to hike
through the Sawtooth Wilderness, while everyone else (Yvonne, Pants, and some
other friends of Peter that joined for the last two days) is departing back
home.

We drive through the impressive mountain range of the North Cascades, where we
pass a vista at Diablo Lake. There we make a short stop.

We also pass a town that still looks like an old Wild West town, before we make
it to the cabin of Peter's parents at Gold Creek. Peter's father, who drove us,
will stay there during our hike and pick up us afterwards. We have lunch
(sandwiches that we bought on the way) at the cabin, unload luggage that we will
not need during the hike, and pack final things before driving to the trail
head.

We start hiking in warm, sunny weather.

But soon clouds start forming.

Then we start hearing thunder in the distance. I hope that we will not get into
a thunderstorm with lightning when we have to cross a ridgeline not that far
ahead. That could be dangerous. A short while later we feel some raindrops, but
not enough to be worth putting on rain gear. Then it suddenly starts getting
more and we stop to put on our rain jackets (Peter is the only one who also
brought rain pants). Just in time before the down pour starts. A few minutes
later the rain turns into hail!

With the rain it also gets a bit chilly, so we have to keep moving to stay warm.
After 15 minutes or so, before we make it up the ridgeline, the heavy rain turns
back into more light rain. Once we cross the ridgeline it fully stops again.

Shortly after, we approach a lake that is our first potential camp spot. We do
not have pre-booked campsites as in the wilderness area (though we are
technically not in that area yet) you are allowed to camp anywhere. So we have
some flexibility, but we still have a long way ahead of us and are still fresh.
Thus, we decide to press on to not later run into risk not being able to finish
the hike in time.

On the next ridge line we finally cross the official border into the wilderness.

Near Chipmunk Pass (I believe) we set up our first camp. After dinner a light
rain starts again, so we go to bed. It rains for most of the night.

We hiked 17.7km in 5:45h today. During that we ascended 1064m, to a peak of
height of 2268m, and descended 445m.
