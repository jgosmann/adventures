The weather in Munich is gray and somewhat wet currently. However, just for this
Sunday, we have blue skies in the Bavarian Alps. Fabian, Martin, Kristina and
I seize the opportunity. From the saddle at the Spitzingsee we hike up towards
the Taubenstein (1692m).

As we gain some height, the snow cover is getting a little bit thicker, but
hiking boots are still fine. However, we want to ascent the Taubenstein via the
Southern ridge line and have to eventually leave the well trodden trail. The
approach leads us through deep snow. Without our snow shoes we often sink in
more than knee deep. I should have brought some gaiters to prevent snow from
getting into my boots. Even though my pants have inbuilt ones, they are not
quite sufficient for this level of snow.

Once we made it through the snow, it is time to rope up and put on crampons. The
climbing at the ridge line is easy (<Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />) and thus
we will not belay each other, but climb simultaneously, all of us clipped into
the same rope. When passing a bolt, we unclip the front rope strand, and
clip in the back rope strand to the next person. This way we are at least
protected from a catastrophic fall, but a fall should still be avoided at all
costs in this setup.

After the summit,we descend a little bit and have a lunch break on a nearby
boulder. We remind ourselves of <Link to="/posts/200111-rotwand/">a tour almost
three years back</Link> where we did not manage to get up the Taubenstein with
our snow shoes.

Next, we want to hike over to the Aiplspitze. But after a saddle, we find a sign
that the trail goes through a protection area for wild animals that one should
not enter in winter. Thus, we change plans, descend about additional 200m and
then summit the Jägerkamp (1746m) which involves again trudging through deep
snow. As we near the summit, the sun is already hanging pretty low given the
short days at this time of year.

From the summit itself, we have the view into the flatter landscape with Munich
in front of the Alps. At least the Eastern part is covered in low hanging
clouds. The weather is really much better in the mountains today!

Finally, we descend back to the Spitzingsee saddle. The last bit we run across
a snow-covered pasture and catch the bus back with 3 minutes to spare. It is
also around sunset, so we made it back before getting into the dark.
