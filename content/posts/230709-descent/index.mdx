Even though we are now fully acclimatized, we cannot make use of it. Sadly, it
is our last day and all that remains is the descent.

After a great breakfast with delicious house-baked bread and scrambled eggs, we
start the descent shortly before 8am. It only takes us a little bit more than an
hour, but the landscape is quite beautiful once more. At the valley station of
the ropeway for the hut's material transport, a taxi picks us up and brings us
to Margret's car, which is parked at the Tauernhaus, the starting point of this
five day tour. From there we drive back to Munich.
