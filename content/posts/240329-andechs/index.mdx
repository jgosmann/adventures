My parents are visiting over the Easter weekend. Given the good weather, we do
an easy hike from the Lake Starnberg to the Lake Ammer via the Andechs Monastery
on Good Friday.

We reach Starnberg conveniently with the S-Bahn. After a short detour to the
nearby castle with a great view across the lake to the Alps in the distance, we
soon leave the village and follow a trail along the stream of the Maisinger
Schlucht. Quite a lot of families are walking here too. But the crowds thin out
as as we pass a lake that the stream ends in.

After crossing some lovely Bavarian landscape, with an amazingly clear view of
the Alps due to the foehn weather, and crossing some woods, we finally get
a view of the Andechs Monestary.

Not much longer and we reach the Monestary. Here it is quite busy again. It is
a popular destination, especially on a Holiday. No chance to get a seat in its
beer garden. Thus, we walk to a nearby caf√© to have some drinks and eat some
Tarte Flambee.

Finally, we hike the last few kilometers to Herrsching from Lake Ammer from
where we take the S-Bahn back to Munich.

Hiking the 19.5km took us about 4:20h. We ascended about 200m and descended
a little bit more with 275m. The peak elevation was about 700m.
