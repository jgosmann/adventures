Since I returned from Fontainebleau, the weather on weekends has been too
unstable for any worthwhile tours into the mountains. But, finally, this
Saturday is supposed to be nice until the evening (when the rain will return).
Reason enough to do at least a short tour. Everyone else already had other
plans, so I am on my own.

As I want to do some famous ridge climbs in the future, I figured I should start
trying an “easy” (or mainly short one first). The mountain Hoher Gaif (2288m)
should be an ideal test piece for today. It will also be a nice tour to test out
my new backpack that I bought for alpine tours.

The day starts with an early train from Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Then
it is two stops with the Zugspitzbahn (train running up the Zugspitze) and the
gondola up to the Osterfelderkopf. From there you get a great view of the
Alpspitze.

However, such a popular and overrun peak is not my goal today. Instead,
I descend to the Bernadeinwände (Bernadein walls) to ascent the Bernaideinkopf
(2143m) via the Mauerläufer ferrata. <Link to="/posts/190921-mauerlaeufer/">Two
years ago I did it for the first time.</Link> With a difficulty rating of D/E it
is considered to be hard, actually, to be Germany's most difficult via ferrata.
It is no problem for me, though, and I make my way up quickly. I think it is
a really enjoyable via ferrata that follows the rock structures in a logical way
and provides nice climbing movements.

Soon I get to the ladder that is often depicted in the guide books. But usually
from behind which makes it appear to be much longer than it
actually is.

After passing the ladder, I catch up with two guys in front of me. They are
struggling a bit, especially one of them, and he has to rest for quite a while
in his safety sling. When he tries to continue, it gets stuck and his partner
has to come back down and help him to get it removed. From what I can see it
looks like a somewhat messy and needlessly complicated system. Shortly after
that spot is a place where they can rest and let me pass. But first they ask for
how long it will continue. Luckily it is only short stretch before the climbing
eases up. Of course they did not bring the topo themselves. Despite this
holdup, I reach the top in one hour and twenty minutes which is only five
minutes longer than last time. Guidebooks usually state a time of two and a half
hours. At the summit of the Bernadeinkopf I take a rest to eat a bit and enjoy
the view.

So far the warm up, now I descend towards the Stuibensee (“lake Stuiben”). It is
a quite idyllic scenery with the calm lake and its green-blueish water in the
meadow. But on the other side, the Hoher Gaif is imposing and gives a good
overview of the route yet to come. It is always good to check the route from
a vantage point, where you get a good overview, in order to not get lost. Once
you are closer to the wall it can get hard to know where exactly you are without
a marked trail.

After passing the Stuibensee, I have to ascent carefully through some scree
without sliding too much and potentially going all the way back down. Next
follow some Schrofen, which means the terrain gets steeper but not that steep
that you need your hands often. Mostly it is mix of grassy steps and some rocks.
When I reach a steel cable, I know that I am on the right path and quickly get
to a grassy hillside that I continue to ascend to get to the ridge.

I climb the first few meters of the ridge line and then get an incredible view
into the Reintal. It goes down 1000 meters with almost nothing in-between. That
is almost the height of El Capitan above the Yosemite valley, in case this is
a helpful comparison for you. And the equally high rock face on the other side
of the narrow valley makes this view even more impressive.

<Rimg src="25.jpeg" caption="That goes down a lot!" />

Seeing the chasm to my right and at the same time an even deeper abyss on my
left, a slight panic starts to creep up. What am I doing up here? Do I really
want to continue? I have to climb all of this back too! And down climbing tends
to be harder than climbing up. What if I get a complete mental lock down, cannot
move either forward or backward anymore and have to call the mountain rescue (if
I still have the mental capacity to do so)? Will I find the proper climbing
route along this ridge line (you cannot get lost, but you can climb
either on top of the ridge, slightly to the left, or slightly to right)? I have
not climbed it before and do not now the easiest line yet!

But then my mental control, kicks in. Panicking won't help! Calm down! Right now
I have a solid stance and I am not in immediate danger. I am still able to act.
The climbing grade of this ridge is <Grade system="UIAA" value="1" /> with some
parts <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />. That is well within my abilities of
strength, endurance, and climbing technique. Yes, I'm high up and a fall would
most certainly be deadly, but given my climbing abilities and the mostly solid
rock, it is also quite unlikely. So once I accept the remaining risk, it is not
helpful to wallow in these thoughts. Instead I focus on the bit before me.
Every bit I move forward, I will have climbed once and thus should be able to
back climb it. At each step I can decide anew whether I still want to continue
or turn around.

The panic succumbs and only a little anxiousness of climbing into unknown
terrain remains. Thus, I continue a for a bit, and then another bit. The
narrower ridge parts are broken up with slightly wider parts which let me relax
a bit more. Then I am almost at the top of a peak, and hope that I made it. But
from the top of that slight peak, I see another one. Still I decide to continue.
The pattern repeats itself a few times, but I am starting to get calmer. And
then I am at the summit of the Hoher Gaif!

There I meet two other mountaineers and we take photos of each other with the
summit cross. I enjoy the view, note myself down in the summit book, and eat the
rest of my lunch to make sure my blood sugar is sufficient for the way back.

Eventually, all three of us start the down climb (the same way we came up). The
clouds are getting more and all of us want to avoid having to climb the ridge in
the rain. Surprisingly, the way back turns out to be easier. Coming down from
a higher vantage point it is much easier to see potential lines and choose the
easiest one. Also, having climbed this in one direction, things are already
somewhat familiar. I finally also remember to take a picture of this ridge line.
Mostly I was just completely focused on the climbing and did not think of taking
pictures.

During the down climb of the crux corner, with the view directed downwards
instead of upwards, the exposure of that spot became much clearer to me. But
I stayed calm, controlled, and fearless. Someone else put a video on Youtube
climbing this spot (and the ridge in general) if you are interested. Viewer
discretion is advised if you suffer easily from vertigo or motion sickness
(shaky head camera). Note that wide-angle lens used makes this look a bit more
extreme than it is in reality.

I (and the other two climbers) make it safely down from the ridge. While we
follow the trail back to the Stuibensee, a rescue helicopter appears, flies
toward the Alpspitze, circles it a couple of times, and disappears behind it for
quite a while. Eventually, it flies back, returns a while later to then finally
disappear for good. I suppose some accident must have happened there.

I pass the Stuibensee again where have another short break for an energy bar
and to enjoy the idyllic scenery. Then I continue to descend to the Kreuzeckhaus
where another gondola can bring me down. There I decide to skip the next
train, but wait for the one an hour later to eat a snack and drink a Radler at the
Kreuzeckhaus. My own food is nearly gone, my water is completely gone and
I am hungry and thirsty. From the hut's terrace I have a nice view back to the
Osterfelderkopf, Bernadeinkopf, and Alpspitze as they slowly get engulfed in
clouds. But the rain does not really start until I am back at the train station
in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. When I arrive back in Munich it has already stopped.

Overall, the tour took me 6:30h from the Osterfelderkopf to the Kreuzeckhaus.
I ascended 800m and descended 1115m. But more important than the raw facts is
the gain in experience. Now, I have a better understanding where my (current)
mental limits regarding exposure and unsecured climbing may lie. The margin for
mentally handling things in case something does not go as planned is definitely
less with that kind of exposure. This makes a thorough planning, close
attention to the weather forecast etc. to widen this margin especially
important, should I attempt similar tours in the future. But I also learned
that I even in such an extreme situation I still have some control over my
mental state and can re-focus on what is important.

While I do not think that today's tour was reckless, I will not deny that it
involved (hopefully well calculated) risks. Which leaves me with the question:
why does someone, why do I, accept these risks? Why climb a mountain? Currently,
I have no better answer than George Mallory's “because it's there”.
