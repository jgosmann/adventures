We start the day with a proper German breakfast including bread and cereal at
8am. Then we put on our snow shoes and start the long hike for the day.
After descending a little bit, we want to climb the Himmeleck, then traverse the
ridge line with the Klamme, Denneberg, and Prodel, before descending again to
Lanzenbach from where we make a final ascent to the Staufner Haus on the
parallel ridge line.

The weather in the morning is really sunny and warm (but it got cloudy later).
I quickly notice that my normal winter hike clothing is not appropriate if
I don't want to drown in my own sweat and have to take off my long johns.
Luckily, we are the only people in the area and can freely take off my pants. In
fact we won't see another human until we reach Lanzenbach which is quite rare in
the Alps, but nice.

On the descend I have a little mishap. I got a new backpack (more comfortable
than my old one and many useful features, especially for snow shoe hikes) that
allows to store bottles on the sides in a way that keeps them accessible without
taking off the backpack. But a one liter bottle protrudes quite a bit and as
I shoulder the backpack after a short break, the bottle falls out of the pocket,
follows gravity and disappears into a ravine running into the valley.
Fortunately, we have to descend into exactly that direction and the bottle left
an easy to follow track on the snow. I have no trouble at all finding the bottle
and now I know to be more careful.

While we were approaching the Prodel, the snow cover got less and we had to take
of the snow shoes for the descent to Lanzenbach.

Down in the valley, the final ascent of the day awaits us. A brutal 700m of
elevation gain after an already long hike. Even though the road gets snow
covered again higher up, we are all too tired and lazy to put the snow shoes
back on. With the help of our hiking poles we can reduce slippage to a minimum
and the snow is compressed enough that we do not sink in much.

Finally, we arrive exhausted at the Staufner Haus around 5pm. It is quite busy.
It gets a bit quieter in the evening as a larger group leaves and descends back
into the valley, but we are certainly not the only overnight guests.
Nevertheless we get our own tiny secluded room of communal bunks that ends up
smelly due to our sweat trenched clothes. Even Merino wool fabrics can only do
so much.

Before we fall asleep in there, we have another three course dinner. Most of us
take the spinach [Kn√∂del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del) with feta
cheese as a main, except for Martin who has the [Kasspatzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4sesp%C3%A4tzle).

We hiked a distance of almost 20km, descended 1050m, and ascended a total of 1300m.
Our highest peak was about 1650m and we took about 7:30h. Given that my backpack
was weighing a total of up to 15kg (including snow shoes, avalanche safety
equipment, food, water), this is quite an accomplishment, I think.
