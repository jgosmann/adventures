Given the rainy weather, we sleep in. I spend the morning reading. After lunch,
Alex, Anna, and I go for a short round of walking along a nearby trail. There
are some muddy parts, but we are not deterred. Our rewards is that we come
across a fire salamander.

To make use of all the time and given the well equipped kitchen with
a [Spätzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle)
[maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle#/media/File:Spaetzlehobel.jpg),
we decide to make
[Käsespätzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4sesp%C3%A4tzle) from scratch.
For that, I grate a kilogram block of cheese. It turns out quite tasty!
