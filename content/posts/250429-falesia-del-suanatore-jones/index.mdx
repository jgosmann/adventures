We have a relaxed start into the day after yesterday's accident and late bedtime.
Anna obviously cannot climb and not even get around the house until she gets
some crutches. Thus, Antoine also stays home, while Anja, Jonas, and I go
climbing at the Falesia del suonatore Jones.

Again we start with easier routes, but even the <Grade system="french"
value="5a" /> Sagnatori Confusionali non-trivial with a layback crack.
Eventually, I try a slightly harder route, Pulin <Grade system="french"
value="6a+" />. It starts on nice sinters, but the last move is far, on really
painful holds to a really sharp side-pull. After a couple of tries, I give up to
save my skin.

Nevertheless, I attempt the even harder Cena rossa a quarzina <Grade
system="french" value="6b+" />. The initial part comes out right of a small
roof. Then one has to traverse the slightly slabby face to the left before
continuing up. It was sort of clear, what awaits one there. But once I am there,
a bit above the last bold, it looks much farther and I have a “what the f\*\*\*?
I have to get over there?” moment. I collect myself and after a while I find
a small two finger pocket, the right foot placement (the left foot must not be
too far left and then its a step through with the right), and some undercling
crimps. Then I was already at a juggy pocket introducing the enjoyable
finish.

On the way back, we grab a ice-cream at our gelato place. For dinner we drive to
Finalborgo, the old city core of Finale Ligure. There we find a place that feels
quite authentic Italian with excellent food. As starter I have some sort of
salmon tartar with mango, bulgur, and quinoa that was really delicious. But also
the pasta and pana cotta afterwards where quite good.
