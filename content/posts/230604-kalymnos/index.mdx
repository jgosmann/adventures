Sadly, we have to depart today. In two loads again, we shuttle everyone and all
bags from Masouri back to Pothia. After returning the rental car, we have about
an hour to wait for the ferry. This time it is a much larger ferry that brings
us to the main city of Kos. The size makes the ride much less bumpy and more
enjoyable than on the arrival.

We have lunch in Kos and then take a taxi to the airport. The check-in and
security check are done quickly. However, the flight is delayed by about two
hours because the aircraft still needs to arrive. We are given some vouchers for
food, but the airport prices are expensive and you get barely anything with it.
Once we finally boarded, we have to wait another 30 minutes because of some
weather warning before we can finally depart. We arrive with almost 3 hours
delay in Munich. Unfortunately, everything there is already closed, so we can't
get any food and have to be content with some energy bars for dinner.

All in all, it was an enjoyable vacation with a good mix of some easier and some
harder climbing, as well as some relaxing. The climbing on Kalymnos is varied
and well protected, so that one can try hard stuff without being too afraid. The
pretty consistently dry weather is definitely a plus too. Though, we might have
gotten somewhat lucky concerning temperatures this year. Supposedly, it is
usually already a bit warmer around end of May.
