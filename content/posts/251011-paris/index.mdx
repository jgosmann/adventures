I was staying in Paris for the EuroRust conference the last couple of days.
I extended the trip by a day to do some sightseeing. In particular, I want
to visit the Notre-Dame. When I was visiting Paris six years earlier, it had
just burned down, and now it is reconstructed.

I start with a tour to the top of the South tower that has just reopened a few
weeks ago. However, it was barely worth it. Despite having a booked time slot,
I have to wait twice for quite a while and we are only allowed five minutes to
enjoy the view from the top.

Afterwards, I line up at the end of the long, but fast moving line to visit the
actual cathedral interior (which is free of charge). This is a much better
experience.

Having enjoyed the spacious interior, I grab some lunch nearby and
enjoy the sunny weather on a bench by the Seine river for a while. Eventually,
I walk a bit more towards the Louvre, before taking the metro to the meeting
point for a street art tour organized by the conference.

At the meeting point, more and more participants gather, but no guide shows up.
After calling the organizers, we find out that the tour had to be cancelled
because the guide is sick. The guiding company couldn't reach the organizers, so
we weren't told before. We then end up taking a long walk through Paris back to
Notre-Dame. Then most of us have dinner together before parting ways in the late
evening.
