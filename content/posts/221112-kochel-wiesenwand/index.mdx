With temperatures up to 13°C forecasted, Fabian and I decide to have another
sport climbing day in Kochel despite it being already November. But when we meet
at the Munich Central Station, it is only slightly about freezing and foggy.
Even after the train and bus ride, of about 90 minutes, it is still quite cold
when we arrive at the Wiesenwand (“pasture wall”), that we picked because it is
more or less South facing. Unfortunately, the fog is still thick and the warmth
of sun peaking over the mountain tops is not really making it through.

Nevertheless, we start to warm up on a few easier routes. The first one is easy
enough so that I climb it with gloves and still get slightly cold fingers. The
second route I climb without gloves and get slightly colder fingers, but it is
still bearable as the routes aren't super long. The third route,
Buckelwiese <Grade system="UIAA" value="6/6+" /> turns out to be quite physical (but fun) in
comparison to the first two warm ups. Now I and my hands get finally warm.

We continue to climb the classic route Museumssteig <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" />.
One can tell that it is a classic because there is a clear grass-free spot on
the pasture in front of it. Also, a quite nice route. Now it is definitely
getting warmer and some more climbers appear to make use of the optimal sending
temperatures.

We then take a short walk to the nearby power station's visitor center to use
their restrooms. Unfortunately, it turns out they are closed over the winter
months and thus the nearby forest must suffice.

Finally, we climb Analtrakt <Grade system="UIAA" value="7-" /> (“anal tract“),
apparently named after one moist two-finger pocket in the route. Luckily, the
climbing is better than the name suggests, but the crux right after the start
feels much harder than the <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+" /> route
Museumssteig. It also takes me quite a while to figure the beta, but then manage
to redpoint it in the second try. Maybe some holds on the route broke and it
used to be a bit easier, but maybe it is just stiff grading.

After a good day of climbing, we take the train back to Munich. There we are
greeted again with fog and low temperatures.
