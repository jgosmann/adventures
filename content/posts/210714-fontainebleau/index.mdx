Unfortunately, our time in Fontainebleau has come to an end. We leave at 7am
and drive back to Paris. There we return the rental car and then take the Métro
from Gare de Lyon to Gare de Paris-Est. This time without any incidents.

At the Paris-Est station we still have over an hour before our train leaves and
we want to grab some breakfast. However, it is Bastille Day, a national holiday,
and almost everything is closed. Eventually, we find an open café just outside
of the train station and order all a French breakfast with baguette and Pain au
Chocolot (but not as good as the one yesterday).

The train back is a German ICE. We have to change trains in Stuttgart. Our
connecting train is delayed by about 45 minutes. Luckily, the previous train is
also delayed by 70 minutes, so we can catch that and incur only a slight delay.
We are also lucky that the train is not very full (our reservation are only
valid for the other train) and can sit around a table.

In summary, Fontainebleau is a great location for a boulder vacation. Approaches
are short, one does not have to search for a long time to find boulders, and
there is a huge and varied selection of problems. Despite the popularity, the
rock has grip and is not too polished. It is also convenient to get there
by train from Munich. Only the weather could have been better, but being able to
do at least some climbing on three out of five days isn't too bad either.
