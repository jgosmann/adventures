Because of Covid-19 my vacation plans got cancelled and I am left with quite a
few vacation days that I have to use up in some way or another. Today I
used one of these vacation days quite spontenously to do a hike with Veronika
and Jade up to the
Jochberg (1565m), sometimes referred to as Munich's Hausberg meaning something
along the lines of Munich's local mountain.

When we arrive at Lake Kochel to start our hike, we barely see the lake. There
is a thick cloud of morning fog on it. But that will disappear quickly as it
will be a quite warm day (around 30Â°C).

The first part we hike along a little stream with some nice, small waterfalls.
Then most of the hike we are on an easy trail in the welcome shade of the forest.
At some spots with openings in the forest, we can see the Lake Kochel.
The last short bit we have to hike in the open sun, but also get a good view
of the Walchensee. It looks quite different compared to
the winter with its nice torquise color, in case you remember <Link to="/posts/190126-simetsberg/">my very first post on this blog</Link>.

The final challenge before the summit are a few cows that prefer to stand (or lie down)
on the even trail instead of the grassy slope where they are supposed to be.
While they are usually friendly, being a bit careful does not hurt. If one of
them decides that you are a threat, they are probably on the winning side with
their mass.

After a short break on the summit we descend to the Jochalm where we have
some drinks (coffee, coke, beer mixed with lemonade known as Radler in Germany).
Then we continue to descend to the Walchensee on a rather wide forest
road. Eventually, we find nice narrow trail of moderate difficulty taking
us through the woods. Eventually we reach the Walchensee where we have
another break.

Then it is a bit more walking to get back to Kochel where we take a refreshing
dip into the water before going back home. As this was a relaxed hike we took
between six and seven hours. We ascended and descended about 900 to 1000m.
