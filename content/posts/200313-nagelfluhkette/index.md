While whole Europe is going into shutdown because of COVID-19, we (Fabian,
Martin, Kristina, and me) got lucky to get in a great weekend of hiking and snow
shoeing.

On a Friday shortly after lunch, we board a train to Immenstadt in the beautiful
Allg√§u. From there it is about a two hour hike and 700m ascent to the Kemptener
Naturfreundehaus at 1443m where we will stay for the night.

First, we follow a broad forest service road, but soon get to smaller trails and
actual snow despite the incredible warm winter. Well, most of the snow has a
hard, thick icy crust from melting and refreezing, and we do not need our snow shoes
for quite a while.

But for the last part and final, steep ascent snow shoes do get useful.

We reach the hut still during daylight (around 5pm) and meet a few day guests.
But we are the only group staying overnight together with the personnel. That
means we have all the communal bunks for us and can hord as many blankets as we
want. Before going to sleep, though, we have some cake and a bit later a three
course menu with soup, a giant pan of
[Schupfnudeln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schupfnudel) with Sauerkraut and
sausages, and ice cream.
