For the upcoming week I planned a hike through the Triglav national park in
Slovenia together with Fabian. We will be sleeping in mountain huts, though today
it is the night train from Munich to Jesenice. We booked a couchette, but the
corresponding wagon is missing due to a defect and we have to get comfortable in
a seating carriage. At least we have the whole compartment to ourselves and can
lay down across three seats each. It will be a short night anyways. After having
left Munich at 11:20pm yesterday evening, we arrive already around 5am in
Jesenice.

In front of the train station we wait for our connecting bus.

For only €1.80 for both of us, less than a single ticket in Munich, the bus
brings us to Rateče in the North-West corner of Slovenia, close to Italy and
Austria. This is where we start our hiking trip. It is still dark, but dawn is
setting in slowly. It is an easy walk of 1:10h to the Planinski dom Tamar hut in
the valley.

At the hut, we discuss what to do with the day. The weather is very cloudy and
it might rain. We are also somewhat tired due to the short night. Thus, we
decide against climbing the Jalovec (2645m) which would be a long an difficult
tour. On the map we discover a path to the Srednja Ponca (2228m) that looks like
it might be manageable distance- and elevation-wise.

The low hanging clouds accumulate as water droplets on the vegetation, and
transfer from there onto our pants and hiking boots as we brush against it on
the narrow trail. After the hike we will both have wet feet. The trail itself is
somewhat demanding with easy climbing passages and some passages secured by
steel cables.

On the mountain top, we are still mostly in the fog. But for a short while some
of the clouds lift and we can see a bit of the Italian mountains. The
Italian-Slovenian border runs right across this mountain ridge. It is amusing to
think that we have been in four different countries (Germany, Austria, Slovenia,
Italy) today.

As we descend on the same trail, we are still covered in fog, but it slowly
begins to lift.

Back in the valley the weather starts looking pretty friendly.

We have something to eat and drink at the hut, which has become quite busy with
the sunnier afternoon weather. Fabian orders
[Kaiserschmarrn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiserschmarrn) that is offered
here, surprisingly, but is served in a cheap paper box. Then we check in. This
will be one of the more luxurious nights with a private room and free (warm)
showers.

As it is not dinner time yet, we have a quick walk to the Nadiže spring.

We also check out a memorial for mountaineers that died in the region next to
the hut.

Back at the hut we have Goulash for dinner, one of the typical offerings at
Slovenian mountain huts. Afterwards we use the free shower as it probably will
be last chance for the upcoming week.
