So far, all my vacation plans got cancelled this year, either due to Covid-19 or
due to bad weather. But now I will finally have a little vacation in Arco, Italy
while attending a course on the basics of alpine climbing.

I arranged to be picked up by Riccardo, another participant in the course.
I am a little bit surprised when he arrives with a BMW convertible; not exactly
the car I expect a rock climber to drive. But it is a pleasant 4:30 hour
drive to Arco.

We arrive around noon and have a short introductory round with the other two
participants and our 70-year old, but quite fit, instructor. Then we head out to
the first small crag where we learn about basic slab climbing technique, types
of ropes, and rethreading the rope for lowering. Before concluding the day with
dinner in a pizzeria, I take a stroll through Arco with Riccardo. It has a nice
old city core with many climbing shops.

The next morning, we get to experience the excellent breakfast menu of our hotel
da Gianni. We can choose between a diverse selection of omelets, toast,
crêpes, and fried eggs. We also get fresh fruit juice, bread, croissants,
espresso, and cappuccino served.

Today, we visit another small crag with a popular BASE jumping spot nearby.
The whole day we see jumpers coming down while we learn more belay techniques,
more slab climbing techniques, basics of multi-pitching, and rappelling. For
lunch, we have paninis at a nearby café.

On Monday, we visit a crag that translates to “donkey wall”, but the donkey is
long gone and all we hear are the cries of a cock. We learn how to use a tuber
and prepared anchor slings for alpine climbing as well as a little bit about
placing protection (though much less than in the <Link
to="/posts/190810-keile/">previous specialized course I attended</Link>).
At the end of the day we also climb a few routes just for fun after a lot of
practicing all the techniques. For dinner, in another Italian restaurant (where
we have a lot of seafood), we are joined by two members of the board of the
German alpine club.

After breakfast on Tuesday, we walk to the “slabs of Baone” where we practice
our multi-pitching and rappelling on four pitch routes. It is so slabby that
you can walk up much of it in approach shoes. However the bolt distances are
truly “alpine” with some ~30m pitches with only two bolts in-between the anchors.
On one route many of the bolt hangers are also missing, but tying slings around
the remaining bolts works pretty well. This makes the climbing, despite being
very easy, a bit bold, committing, and exciting.

Around late noon it starts to rain, so we head back to the hotel, have a theory
lesson, and go shopping in Arco. For dinner we meet in a restaurant that serves
rectangular pizzas of about 25cm by 50cm, so every two of us split one pizza.

On our last day before departing back to Munich, we do our first easy (we climb
it in approach shoes), but full alpine tour, the Via del 92° Congresso (<Grade
system="UIAA" value="3" />) on the Monte Baone. While we employ the
belaying techniques and place protection, our instructor climbs unsecured next
to us and provides some tips. The actual climbing (about six pitches) is
separated with multiple walking stretches.

After finishing the climbing part, it is a short hike to the summit of the Monte
Baone at 479m. Then we descend a hiking trail back down to Arco where we have
a sundae each to celebrate.

Unfortunately, this was the last day and tomorrow I am heading back to Munich.
But the course opens a lot of new potential in the Alps for me. Tours like
Waxensteingrat, Jubiläumsgrat, Watzmann Ostwand seem much more reasonable to me
now and I have a better understanding of what these tours demand of me. In
particular, I also gained a better understanding of the lower climbing grades up
to <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" />.
