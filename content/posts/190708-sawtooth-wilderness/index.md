We wake up around sunrise at 5:30am to make the ferry that brings us out of the
wilderness in time.

We first have a short ascend onto a last ridge line.

Finally, we make it to Stehekin, the end of our hike. We still have some time to
spare and look for some food. But the restaurant does not open before 11am. Once
they actually open Alex gets immediately into line and orders three burgers with
onion rings (they were out of fries) for us. Those get devoured before we have
to get in line for the ferry at 11:45am.

elevation of 2137m and a descent of 1758m.

We get picked up by Peter's dad in Chelan who then drives us back to Seattle.
Peter and Alex get dropped at the airport as they are headed back home. My
travels, however are not even halfway over and I will spend the night in
a hostel in Seattle.

I spend the evening enjoying a shower (feels really good after 4 days without)
repacking down to my two backpacks strapped together and my smaller backpack,
and planning out my next day.
