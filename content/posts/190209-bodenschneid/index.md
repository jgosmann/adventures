The temperature climbed to 8Â°C in Munich today, but in higher altitude it is
colder and snow takes time to melt. Thus, Fabian (from last time), another
Fabian, Kristina, Martin, Susanne, and I still had good conditions for
another snow shoe hike to the mountain Bodenschneid.

At 8:04am, we leave from Munich Central Station in a train packed with skiers and
snowboarders. After about an hour we arrive in Neuhaus at the Schliersee from
where we start our hike. The first 10 or 20 minutes we walk through the
village until we hit the start of the actual trail.

The snow on the first part of the trail is packed and no snow shoes are
required.

Once we get to the part where there is deeper snow besides the trail, we finally
put on our snow shoes and the adventure begins.

While approaching some hut, we notice that we are actually not on the right
trail and missed a turn. Unfortunately, we have to descend 50m or so again.
Luckily we do not need to backtrack all the way to where we missed the turn, but
just go off-trail to cut across to our actual trail. This is easy because of the
thick layer of snow. In the summer this would likely be impossible due to the
undergrowth.

After ascending about 800m, we reach the summit at 1669m. There is blue sky to
either side in the distance, giving us a great view. We take a little break to
eat some snacks. I share some awesome [Raw Ginger Energy
Bites](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-recipe/raw-ginger-energy-bites/).
Kristina brought cookies and a hearty cake with spinach which is also pretty
good.

Then, suddenly, we are getting ingulfed in some foggy clouds and the view is
suddenly much worse. We also starting to get a little bit cold. So we gather out
things quickly and start the descend via an alternate, not quite as steep route.

Soon we reach the lower part of the trail where snow shoes are not much use and
we take them off again. We make it back for the 4:49pm train, but it is 15
minutes late. Welcome to Germany ... Anyways, it was again a great hike with
quite some views.

Compared to my snow shoe hikes in Canada, I noticed that you can hear a lot of
birds in the winter in Germany. From Canada I remember hearing no animals at all
with the exception of a woodpecker. The snow in Germany also seems to be wetter
and sticks more together. I assume both is due to the milder winters Germany
(and especially the last days and today were quite warm).
