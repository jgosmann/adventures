After the long day yesterday, we wake up late. Then we notice that we have not
bought enough food yesterday evening and decide that we need to do another
grocery run. Besides some baguettes, we get also some meat to have a barbecue
this evening. While waiting for everyone to get ready, I take some macro shots
of the lavender outside our house. The bees seem to really love it.

After unloading the groceries, we throw our climbing shoes in the trunk and head
to Arbonne-la-Forêt.

There we rent two crash pads, share a pizza, and have some coffee while deciding
where exactly to go to. Unfortunately, we only manage to fit one crash pad into
the trunk filled with our shoes and other stuff. Thus, it gets a bit tight on
the back seats.

Luckily, it is only a short ride to the Isatis area. From the parking it is
a quick walk to the boulders. It is great how you just stumble upon boulders
once you walk a bit into the Fontainebleau forest. Being close to the parking,
this is a popular area, especially at the weekend. Nevertheless, the area is big
enough to slightly disperse everyone.

We first eat our baguettes, and then boulder for the whole afternoon. The
grading is stiff. The hardest climb I do all day is L'Abat-Jour <Grade
system="Fb" value="4c" /> and that required quite a bit of thinking. But in
general the problems are nice and varied, even though crimpy problems outnumber
other problems in this area. If you do not pay too much attention to the nominal
grades, you can have a lot of fun. It is quite nice that the start of problems
is marked on the rock and the color gives some rough indication of the
difficulty. That way one does not have to constantly check the guide book, but
can just try what looks interesting.

At some point, a fly did like my new climbing shoes a lot and sat there for a
long time without moving. I used this opportunity for some more macro shots.

Once we were tired from boulderin,g we brought the crash pads back. This time
we put both of them into the trunk first, could even fit a few backpacks on top,
and had it much more comfortable.

Back at the Airbnb, we relaxed a bit in the sun and fired up the barbecue to
prepare some really delicious and high quality meat. After dinner, we played
a few rounds Codenames before going to bed.
