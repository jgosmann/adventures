Fabian and I decided to do another bicycle tour this weekend. It was forecasted
to rain at night and maybe a bit during the early morning, but then stop and
turn into fairly nice weather. Unfortunately, the forecast was off by a few
hours and it is still raining when we start at 8:30am from Munich. It isn't
a downpour, but putting on full rain gear is definitely not a mistake. Consider
it stoic training through elective hardship, if you will, to start the tour
anyways. Luckily, we know that the weather can only get better.

We begin by following the river Isar south and then crossing west through the
Forstenrieder Park. Due to the rain, the trails are muddy and our bicycles are
soon covered in dirt. After about 30km, the rain starts turning into a light
dripping and at about the 40km mark it stops completely. Incidentally, this is
also the Northern point where we start our loop around the Lake Starnberg.
After passing through the city of Starnberg, we have our first break at the lake
with a view of the distant mountains.

We continue in mathematical positive direction (counterclockwise) around the
lake; until we have another break on the Eastern shore. By then, the overcast
sky broke up into smaller clouds with blue sky in-between. It can get nice and
warm in the sun, though the wind can be a little bit cold.

Not long after, we close the loop and head back into the Fortenrieder Park.
There we have another extended break on a sunny bench. Now the weather has
become really enjoyable.

After a total of 123km I reach home. It took 6:20h of riding and 2:25h of
breaks. Our average speed was 19.3km/h, the maximum 42.6km/h. It was a nice
route because it almost entirely avoided larger roads (unlike some other tours).
Unfortunately, I have to clean my bike now. üòê
