I will stay with my parents in Cortina d'Ampezzo for a week, for some late season
mountain and via ferrata tours. In the morning, we depart from Munich's East
station towards Franzensfeste via Kufstein, Innsbruck, and the Brenner.
At the Brenner, we collect a delay of about 20 minutes and thus miss our
connection in Franzensfeste, so that we have to wait about an hour for the next
one.

From Franzensfeste, we continue to Toblach, where we again have some time to
kill. At least the weather is nice and sunny (though not very warm). The train
line goes through the same valley as the Munich-Venice bicycle route
that <Link to="/posts/220509-muenchen-venedig-day-4/">I followed two years
ago</Link>, reminding me of some good memories.

Eventually, we can board the bus for the final leg that brings us to Cortina.
The route across the Cimabanche mountain pass is still close <Link
to="/posts/220510-muenchen-venedig-day-5/">to the cycling route I took two years
ago</Link>, passing by the Lake Toblach and the Drei Zinnen.

It Cortina, it we walk through the city center to our holiday apartment.
