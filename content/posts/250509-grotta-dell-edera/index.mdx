Finally, the vacation almost over, we visit one of the must-see spots. The crag
Parete Dimenticata with the Grotta dell'Edera. A giant cylindrical, cave-like
structure that has an open roof and giant window. It is quite impressive to look
at.

But as we are standing there in awe, it starts to rain. Luckily, it is just
a short shower and we can soon start some easier warm-ups nearby. They turn out
once more a bit stiff for the grade. In general, my impression so far is, that
easier routes have stiff grading in Finale, but the more moderate or difficult
routes are graded more accurately to even sometimes quite soft.

The route Bingo Bongo <Grade system="french" value="6a+" /> turns out to be also
not that easy. I have to down climb a few times from the crux before making it
through (still in my onsight attempt). It wasn't easy to figure it out and
required trusting some slippery side-pull slopers. The bolt distance was also
not super close and didn't help the mental aspect.

Eventually, Marco and I make our way through the cave that leads into the Grotta
dell'Edera. Good thing, that I packed my headlamp. Without it would have been
difficult to get through the dark cave with a via ferrata like passage. In the
end, one has to squeeze through a narrow opening and then is suddenly right in
the Grotta surrounded by climbing routes. We decide for Bombolo <Grade
system="french" value="6b" /> which turns out to be an amazing climb on juggy
holds. Maybe graded a bit softly.

Later, we have an excellent dinner in Finale. I order some delicious pasta,
colored black with squid ink, gilt-head bream with some veggies, and
a pistachio tiramisu.
