After sleeping in a bit and checking out of the hostel, I wait for Vera and
Christine to pick me up. They are two friends I used to climb with back in
Ontario. First we drive to MEC (the Canadian equivalent of REI), to get stove
fuel and buy climbing shoes because I forgot to pack mine. Unfortunately, they
do not have my comfy size of the models I am interested in. I then decide to get
half-a-size smaller which will give better performance but also promises to get
painful.

Then we look for a place to have lunch at. The line at the sushi place turns out
to be too long, so we settle for Subway. The last todo item is to buy groceries
before we head to Squamish, about an hour north of Vancouver.

We set up our tents on the Mamquam River Campground and then decide to check out
Shannon Falls, maybe even climb a route there if it is dry (it rained a lot the
night before and a bit during the day).

Trying to find one of the walls, we fail to follow the faint and barely visible
path. Vera, however, boldly guides us deeper and deeper into the wet, mossy, and
treacherous forrest. Sometimes, what looks like solid ground, gives in and your
leg ends up disappearing in a hidden hole. Not to mention lots of potential to
slip on wet logs or rocks. Finally, we agree to turn around and relocate the
trail. Once we make it back to trail, we suddenly have no trouble finding it
continuation.  Unfortunately, the wall turns out wet (well, that was not
unexpected). So we had back to the official trail and take a look at the
impressive falls themselves.

We hike up to another wall close by, but it is also wet. The crack of one of the
crack climbs is actually a small stream of running water. Hoping for better
conditions tomorrow and an early start, we head back to camp, have dinner, and
go to sleep.
