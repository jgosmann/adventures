We start the day again with eggs and ham for breakfast. Then, we descend again to
the lake to get drinking water. It is actually almost on today's route, but we
cannot find the exact trail from there and go back up to the hut anyways.

We only need to get to the Koča na Doliču hut, which actually is not very far.
We will get there via system of ledges on the north face of the Kanjavec.
A quite alpine route with impressive views of steep rock faces and some
exposure. It is secured with steel ropes only in very few places. In-between the
grass on the slopes are patches of red-leaved bushes, adding a really nice
complementary color contrast. Despite the alpine nature, we are not the only
ones on the trail, this time. We get overtaken by two other hikers (or trail
runners?) with very light backpacks. We are a bit slower as we have to carry all
our gear again. Later, we meet a woman with a mountain guide coming from the
other direction.

The final challenge is a snow field that needs to be crossed. This is actually
the most risky part without crampons or ice axe. Though, you probably would just
slide down to the bottom of the snow field and stop there if you slipped. Luckily,
I get a decent grip on the upper edge of the snow field with my hands,
except that my gloves get completely wet from this.

After the snow field, we are a bit below the hut, but after only two hours of
hiking it is also quite early in the day. To fill it, we descend quite a bit and
the re-ascend via the Bambergweg, one of the famous approaches to the Triglav.

The Bambergweg itself starts with a via ferrata (B/C or C depending on the guide
book) and has some more short via ferrata parts higher up, while most of it is
unsecured and involves some actual climbing up to <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" />.
We have no via ferrata set with us, but the unsecured climbing parts turn out to
be not any easier than the via ferrata part, so the risk seems to be acceptable
to us. Without the via ferrata set, we are also quite a bit faster which is an
advantage too.

The Bambergweg spits us out into the moon landscape of the plateau below the
Triglav. It is incredibly windy here and we have to put on an additional layer.

We have to hike through the grey rocks and scree for quite some time before we
get to the Koča na Doliču hut. This time, we actually stay there, even though we
still arrive early at 3:40pm and have to wait twenty minutes before we are
allowed to check in. In total, we were hiking for 6:45h today, ascended 1270m,
descended 1285m and were on a peak height of 2515m (but no real summit).

I use the wait to visit the toilets, which are outside of the hut and maybe
a bit unusual for the average German. At least they are water
flushed&nbsp;—&nbsp;manually with water from the bucket next to it.

During the wait, also a family arrives with a little five year old boy, who
walked up all the way here, about 1400m. Quite impressive!

We get a room with a German couple. I notice that both of them have the same
backpack model that I have. We chat with them a little bit over dinner (Goulash
and [polenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polenta)). Like us they plan to
summit the Triglav tomorrow, but they need to descend into the valley on the
same day while we have another night in the hut. Two German girls at the table
next to us discuss to summit the Triglav for the sunrise. But our table prefers
sufficient sleep and a warm bed in the cold hours before the sun warms up
everything. Though, the conditions were certainly ideal to start hiking before
sunrise with a clear full moon night. This night the moon will also shine
through the roof window in our room, making me wonder if it is already dawning
when I wake up shortly in the middle of the night.
