At about 7am, we leave for today's ascent of the Gigalitz (3001m). First, we
have to hike up to the Lappenscharte (a notch in the ridge line). On the way, we
meet an ibex and some chamois. It might be the first ibex that I have ever seen.
It stares at us for a while as we get quite close and then eventually runs away.

We than climb across some big stone blocks on the ridge line to the start of the
climbing route. I lead the first pitch graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="5-"
/>. It starts with a high first bolt on a slab, so no falling here, but luckily
the grade does not exceed <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" /> up to there. Then
follows the crux along quartz crack, which is decently protected with bolts.
Finally, the pitch joins with a quartz streak that Fabian follows leading the
next pitch with a <Grade system="UIAA" value="3+" />, but after that not
exceeding <Grade system="UIAA" value="2" /> and we skip placing protection.

The next two pitches are equally easy. In my pitch there should have been three
bolts, but I miss two of them. But because the pitches where so easy, it would
have be wasted time to search for them.

Now the second <Grade system="UIAA" value="5-" /> crux pitch awaits me. Most of
it gives me no trouble leading. But right at the end is sort of a corner where
the right side is rather overhanging, so that it cannot be climbed as a corner.
The left side is a slab with few holds. In-between is a narrow crack that only
fits some finger tips in a few places. But this is what I have to use. It is
a bit committing, but I make it through without falling. Fabian and I agree that
this felt more like <Grade system="UIAA" value="5+" /> or <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6-" />. Though, it is possible that we did not find the best beta in this
onsight.

We finish by leading a <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" /> pitch each. Those do
not give us any trouble. Then we are on the Gigalitz-Turm (Gigalitz tower). From
there we rappel down about 20 meters and now need to follow the South Eastern
ridge line of the Gigalitz to the summit.

The easiest path does not always follow the ridge
line exactly and is sometimes a bit lower to the West of it. This makes route
finding not that easy. We also decided to coil up the rope for this part (from
above it looked quite easy). Thus, we have to be careful to not make any fatal
steps in what is still graded up to <Grade system="UIAA" value="3" /> climbing.
With some deliberation and route searching we eventually make it to the summit
of the Gigalitz.

After a long lunch break, we see clouds rising above the Scharzenstein that
could turn into a thunderstorm later. Even though it will still take quite some
time and might not happen at all, we decide to start our descent via the regular
path. No need to let this become a problem. Back at the hut we still have time
to relax in the sun and enjoy some drinks, before having spinach
[knödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kn%C3%B6del) for dinner. The thunderstorm
we feared did not come.

The tour today took us about 6 hours excluding breaks of about 90 minutes. The
elevation difference was about 770m.

Because of the amount of people staying at the hut, we had to switch to
a different room of bunk beds for this night. With us in the room is one solo
traveller and a hiking group. As some of us are already lying in the bed and the
rest of us is getting ready for bed, we chit chat a bit and complain about
experiences with other guests in hut's bunk beds that we had. It feels a bit
like a school trip. I sleep quite well this night.

After waking up about half an hour later than the last two days and a relaxed
breakfast, it is time to descent 1200m back into civilization, i.e. Ginzling.
This takes us about 2:30h. Then we take the bus back to Mayrhofen, the
Zillertalbahn train to Jenbach, and wait for over an hour for the connecting
train to Munich. Just as I arrive home it starts to rain. Good timing!
