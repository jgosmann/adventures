After almost all of my colleagues are vaccinated by now, my employer decided to
have an in-person fall retreat after the last few iterations have been canceled.
That means we get the chance to stay a night in the five star superior hotel
Interalpen-Tyrol, enjoy rooms larger than my flat in Munich, excellent food, the
spa and more.

One day of the retreat is dedicated to work-related things and one day is for
leisure activities. This year I am organizing a via ferrata trip. Three
colleagues are joining me, a fourth one canceled at 3am, presumably after a few
drinks at the open bar. The rest of us grabs their
boxed lunches (maybe the only food in this hotel that is rather meh,
unfortunately) and gets shuttled to Haiming where we do the Geierwand via
ferrata.

It is a fairly easy ferrata, with only one or two C spots and everything else
easier. But it is nice and relaxed for me, still being a bit hungover (and
having gotten less than six hours of sleep). For one of us it is also the first
via ferrata, so anything too extreme was out of the question anyways.

At a bench in the middle of the via ferrata we have a lunch break. In the tree
next to us are already some Christmas decorations.

In total we take about 3:30h to ascend and descend the 360m with a peak hight of
about 1075m. Afterwards we eat in a restaurant before it goes back home to
Munich.
