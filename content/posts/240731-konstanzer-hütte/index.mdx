Starting today, Fabian and I are on vacation until the end of the week. We will
spend the time at the Konstanzer Hütte (“Constance cabin”, 1688m) in the
Verwall. Our main goal is to summit the Patteriol (3056m) via the North-East
ridge line.

We arrive by train in St Anton around 11am. From there, we ascend towards the hut
in warm, sunny weather. Along the way, we pass many trails that branch off
towards the Darmstädter Hütte (“Darmstadt cabin“) and we get the feeling that
all paths lead towards it (maybe it is in Rome?).

As we get closer to the cabin, we get the first view of the Patteriol, with the
Kleiner Patteriol (“Little Patteriol“, 2590m) in front. A truly beautiful
mountain!

Not much longer, and after 2:22h instead of the 3:40h estimated by Fabian's
planning app, we reach the Konstanzer Hütte. We had to ascend 500m (and descent
100m in-between) to get here with our backpacks stuffed with heavy climbing
equipment. Now, we have drinks on the terrace and a relaxed afternoon with
a little bit of planning for tomorrow.
