Today will be a long cycling day as I have to cover a distance of at least
130km. The forecast still predicts head winds. Luckily, breakfast is already
served from 7:30am on, and I don't have to tear down my tent. At about 8:30 I am
on my way. I have a good start with an average speed well over 20km/h. Thanks to
the excellent breakfast, I can pull through the first 60km without a break.
Along the way, I pass the Chiemsee, but decide against a swim to
save time. During the break, I consume my own provisions as I am so early that
the beer gardens and restaurants are not really open yet.

Only slightly slower, I continue to Högelwörth, where there is a small monastery
and a nearby beer garden. There, after 96km, I have another break to have a meal
and something to drink, given the hot weather. Up to there, I was on some smaller
gravel paths without a lot of people, but around here it is suddently busy with
tourists, which makes it feel a bit surreal. Afterwards, I take a quick look at
the monastery and into the attached church. Then I am back on my bike, enjoying
a down hill ride headed directly for the Berchtesgaden mountains. Maybe the
nicest view of the entire tour.

In Bad Reichenhall, I stop shortly to get an ice cream for an energy boost for
the now following final ascent to the Hallthurm pass. It gets quite steep in the
end, but at least the cycling path is in the shade of a forest. From the pass it
is a downhill ride towards Berchtesgaden, though unfortunately, mostly on
a large street without separate bicycle path.

In Berchtesgaden, I'm staying again at a youth hostel. Unfortunately, the direct
street towards it is blocked due to some construction. I don't feel like taking
the detour uphill on another large street. Instead I chose the foot path, but it
is that steep and made out of somewhat loose gravel, that I have to push my bike
uphill for the first time in this vacation. It is quite tiring, but eventually
I'm on top of the hill and at today's final location after 136km and 7h of
cycling. My average speed was 19.3km/h with a maximum speed of 54.5km/h.

After check-in and a shower, the next priority is food. Unfortunately, there is
nothing nearby, so I have to get back onto my bicycle and ride another round to
get back into the core of Berchtesgaden. Somehow this involves going more
downhill than I had the impression of going up to the youth hostel. In
Berchtesgaden, I have a pizza and an Aperol Spritz. On the way back, I take the
detour along the large road instead of pushing my bike. It is actually not that
far, but at this time there is also a lot less traffic. Getting dinner added
another 13km (without luggage) bringing my total for today up to 149km. This is
probably the most I ever did in a single day.
