On my second free day in Brussels, I walk up to the district with the European
institutions. The way leads me along the Mont des Artes with a nice view, some
beautiful buildings, murals, and the palace.

I first visit the Parlamentarium, an exhibition about the history of European
Union and their institutions. Following lunch in a nearby poke place, I stroll
through the buildings and parks in the district.

Before it starts to rain, I make into the House of European History, where
I spend the remainder of the afternoon. Afterwards, I get some delicious ramen
for dinner and spend the evening packing for my departure tomorrow morning.
