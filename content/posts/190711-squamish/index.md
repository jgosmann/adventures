Today is the first day of climbing! Because it is still somewhat wet from
yesterday, we decide to go to the Cheakamus Canyon area. It is supposed to dry
quickly and has some overhanging stuff that does not get wet.

There we warm up on a juggy, slightly overhanging climb called Boy Pie and
a proper slab called Mirror Image. It won't be the last slab as we discover that
there are many slab climbs around Squamish. After the warmup, we move on to
Kigijushi, a fantastic 5.10c, that is regarded as one of the top 100 Squamish
climbs.  I already onsighted it about two years ago when I was in Squamish for
a single day, but today I pump out and do not get a clean sent. Given it is the
first day and I could not climb much lead this year so far (for reasons out of my
control), I am ok with this.

Next we tackle the 3-pitch route Sacrilege with each of us three leading a
single pitch. I get the third pitch, the crux pitch (5.10a). It is slabby!
That makes it a little bit scary; I almost slip once, but can recover and
onsight it. Afterwards, the girls tell me they have no idea how I led that. The
second rappel down (of two total) was also one of the best I did. You get about
30m of completely free hanging rappel.

Before heading back to the campsite, we do another quick 5.8 slab climb which
I believe to be Kingfishers Catch Fire. On the way back, we stop at the Tantalus
Viewpoint with a great view of the Tantalus mountain range.

For dinner we heat canned food directly on the stoves. To our amusement
Christine has quite some trouble opening her can with the swiss army knife's can
opener.
