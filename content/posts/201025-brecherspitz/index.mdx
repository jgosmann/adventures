After a bunch of cold and gray fall weather, we surprisingly get another really
sunny day with warm temperatures this late in October. This chance has to be
used and so Fabian, Martin, Kristina and I find ourselves at the train station
at 7am. We are planning on such a big tour that we really have to leave this
early, but daylight saving time in Europe ended this night and thus it is more
like 8am for physiologically.

We take the train to Fischhausen/Neuhaus close to the Schliersee (“lake
Schlier”). From there, we follow a wide gravel hiking trail. Walking uphill
it gets warm quickly, until we reach a plateau, channeling the wind, forcing us
to put a layer back on.

Once we put on some more clothes, we continue our ascent along a narrower trail
leading us to the summit of the Brecherspitz (1685m). While my previous October
hikes where pretty snowy, today, all the snow is gone due to some warmer
temperatures at altitude over the last week.

After a lunch break (or rather second breakfast if you go by the time as it is
still early), we descend on the other side of the summit, following a U-shaped
ridge line, and then we descend into a valley. The trail gets quite muddy and it
is easy to slip and slide. My pants are definitely going to be in need of a wash
when this is over.

Then, we walk around the <Link to="/posts/190209-bodenschneid/">Bodenschneid that
we already have summitted in winter</Link> and come to a valley with fall
colors.

We could walk the direct route to Tegernsee (the city that lies next to the lake
Tegernsee and has exactly the same name even containing the German word for
lake), but decide for the nicer Tegernseer Höhenweg (“Tegernsee high route”).
A Höhenweg is usually a trail that is at a certain higher elevation to have
a fairly flat trail avoiding a lot of strenuous elevation change in-between
different valleys. However, we are surprised how much up and down the Tegernseer
Höhenweg has. I suppose that close to the valley you cannot expect a real
Höhenweg. Nevertheless, it is quite beautiful this time of year with the golden
leaves.

Then, the final stretch before we reach the train station to end the hike, we
walk through the somewhat snobby Tegernsee, were we feel a little bit at the
wrong place in our dirty hiking cloths.

The hike took us a bit under six hours and we ascended and descended about
1170m.
