After a fall break, I finally got outdoors again together with Fabian, Martin, and
Kristina. Fabian, the early riser as always, made us take the train at 7:04am.
About an hour later we start our hike at the Spitizingsee and plan to hike up
to the Taubenstein and then summit the Rotwand.

After a short stretch of a road with little snow, we vear off the road into
deep, but quite hard snow. We gain elevation quickly. However, we have to turn
around a few meters before the summit of the Taubenstein because the slope is
getting too steep. Surprisingly, it does not look that steep until you actually
try to climb it.

So we decide to skip that summit as the Rotwand will be higher and in
the foggy weather we will not get a view (the forecast said it would be
sunny). While turning around, we meet a couple headed the same way which we
quickly leave behind us.

It is also snowing a little bit. Weirdly, the snow flakes are mostly not
hexagonal but little ice needles. Similar, but larger needles are growing on
exposed structures.

When we make it to the summit of the Rotwand (1,884m) it is still foggy. But we
have some hot apple cider with Amaretto to console us.

On the descend, we stop at the Rotwandhaus where we have another hot drink. When
getting ready to continue, we meet the couple from earlier again. Their snow
shoes were not as good as ours for alpine conditions, and they told us that they
were extremly lucky that they could follow our tracks on the more difficult
parts. Unfortunately, they lost them at some point, then ended up lost
(navigation can be difficult without GPS in foggy conditions and if everything
is white snow), but made it the Rotwandhaus with their phone's GPS. Quite an
adventure for what was their first snow show tour ever. Apparently, this tour
was listed as easy to moderate on an internet site. (Morale of the story: do not
trust everything on the internet.)

During the descend we stop a one point to adjust our clothing layers and
I notice that apart from the noises we make ourselves it is completely silent.
I realize how rare it is to experience such silence when living in a city where
there is always a minor noise background and enjoy it while it lasts.

We reach the village Geitau just a few minutes before a train departs. It
goes in the wrong direction, but the upcoming stop is the terminal stop
where it will turn around and go back to Munich. So we board it anyways to be in
warmth; even though it was hardly a cold day (our ticket is valid for any number
of trips that day).

Without the break in the Rotwandhaus, we spent six hours on the hike, ascended
about 960m and descended 1270m.
