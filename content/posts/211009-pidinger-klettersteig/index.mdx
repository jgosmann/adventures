This weekend, I am staying together with Fabian, Martin, Kristina, and Susanne in
a holiday flat in the small village of Petting. We arrived yesterday evening
and cooked a delicious cauliflower curry for dinner. Today we have planned the
Pidinger via ferrata. It is a very long ferrata (difficulty D)
leading up to the summit of the Hochstaufen (1771m).

<Loc latlong={[47.75867, 12.85284]} />

We wake up at 6am to have enough safety-margin time-wise. The 90 minute approach to the via ferrata is not
very interesting as it is mostly on a gravel road. It is still
foggy, but as we get closer to the wall the fog becomes lighter and we get even
a little bit of sun.

The via ferrata starts with a difficult section.

We soon rise above the cloud cover. Though, we are in the North face and thus
mostly in the shade with cold fall temperatures.

After a stretch of walking to traverse along the wall, we get to the first
emergency exit. We, however, will continue on the proper via ferrata after
having a second breakfast. The next part until the second emergency exit will be
of sustained difficulty. It is a quite steep face to ascent.

After the second emergency exit, the via ferrata eases up for a while.

The final long stretch gets quite difficult again. It starts with some slippery
slab and gets steeper afterwards.

From the exit of the via ferrata, we can already see the summit.

After a summit lunch break with cake, we start our descend. There are two
descend options and we decide for the more difficult one, which consists of
a long part with many climbing spots of <Grade system="UIAA" value="1" />.

Eventually, we get back to forested areas. The trails are partially muddy and
very slippery, but the golden sunlight shining through the autumn leaves is
beatiful, especially as it is pronounced by some waves of fog moving through the
air.

The whole tour took us about 8:30h without breaks (of which we took about 5:30h
to get to the summit). We ascended and descended about 1350m.
