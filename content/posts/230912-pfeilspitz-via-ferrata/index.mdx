It is our last day in the Zillertal. My mum does a relaxed hike near Mayrhofen,
while I do the Pfeilspitzwand via ferrata (C/D) with my dad. We have it done
several years ago already, but it is enjoyable to repeat.

After 1:20h we reach the top. A few minutes later we are at the Zimmereben inn.
It is closed, but they have a vending machine for drinks. After the
refreshments, we descent to our holiday flat and spent the remaining day with
packing for tomorrow's departure.

We had amazingly stable and sunny weather this vacation. Only this evening the
weather turns for the first time and we get a thunderstorm.
