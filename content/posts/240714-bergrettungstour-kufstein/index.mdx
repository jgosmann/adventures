Today, Fabian and I want to do the multi-pitch climb “Bergrettungstour”
(“mountain rescue tour”) near Kufstein. After walking a bit through Kufstein, we
get to the point where a thin trail branches off from the road. It is supposed
to bring us to the start of the route. We follow the blue trail markings until
we get to a metal door in the rock face. This isn't quite the right spot. We
double check the descriptions and apparently the markings are supposed to be red
and we should be more to the South. So we backtrack to the street, but don't see
another trail. In the hope to find the trail closer to the rock, we ascend
directly through the woods until we get to something trail-like that takes us
along the rock and up gully with a lot of loose rock. It turns out to be also
wrong. We descend a bit and find another trail that leads us farther along the
rock face until we suddenly hit a trail with red markings; the one we were
looking for. Finally! A little bit later, we are at the start of tour. It
took us a bit longer (75 minutes) than expected.

Unfortunately, the first two meters are a bit wet. Fabian tries to lead the
first pitch, but is unable to make it past the first bolt. So I get to try. With
quite some effort, I can make it through. Somehow the spot is only graded <Grade
system="UIAA" value="6-" />. Afterwards it is easier and Fabian also manages to
get past it seconding the pitch.

I get to lead again on the third pitch, which turns out to be quite nice with
some layback moves, graded <Grade system="UIAA" value="6" /> but no problem for
me. On one small ledge, next to a corner, I take a moment to figure out how to
continue. As I turn a bit to continue, my calf touches some flake that breaks
off before I even notice touching it, and it flies down. Luckily, it misses
Fabian by a large margin. So all the damage it did, was a small cut in my calf.
I did not expect such an innocent movement, where I wasn't even placing my foot,
to cause such dangerous rock fall!

The sixth pitch starts with the <Grade system="UIAA" value="6+/7-" /> crux of
the whole tour. Fabian aids it on lead. I manage to climb it clean on my second
try seconding it. It is just two or three physical moves.

I find the ninth pitch (that I have to lead), only graded <Grade system="UIAA"
value="6-" /> much harder. It goes through a wet chimney. The topo says to stem
in it to avoid the wet spots, but this isn't really sufficient. I finally manage
to make it through by pulling on some quickdraws, but I do not enjoy this
pitch. Furthermore, it also changes into a traverse after the chimney and the
rope drag gets horrendous.

As stand on a comfortable ledge here, we have a lunch break and enjoy the view.
While it was quite cloudy in the morning, it has gotten sunny by now.
Fortunately, the wall is mostly facing North and we are in the shade.

The remaining pitches are all quite enjoyable again. Especially the last pitch,
that I am leading again, with a combination of a crack and corner is great.
I even get to climb the first part of the pitch twice because I forgot to take
enough quick draws and had to be lowered off to collect some more.

After 6:45h and about 400m of climbing, we top out. From here, it is another
hour back to Kufstein. At the town square is a fountain, where we
can refill our now empty water bottles before boarding the train back to Munich.
It is quite welcome.

Except for that one wet chimney, I did enjoy the route a lot. It was well
protected, the climbing quite enjoyable and sufficiently challenging without
being a struggle. However, the grading of the individual pitches was a bit
weird. Often I found spots with lower grades much harder than spots with higher
grades.
