I'm staying with my parents in Grindelwald for a bit over a week. We arrived
yesterday, and today is our first tour day.

We take the Eiger glacier express gondola up, that drops us close to the famous
Eiger north face. After a short hike, we reach the start of the Rotstock (2663m)
via ferrata, which goes partly through the farthest extend of the Eiger north
face. It is a bit wet in the beginning, but quite easy, so that it isn't
a problem.

Next to the via ferrata are two actual rock climbers in a multi-pitch route
that doesn't look easy.

On the summit, we have a break before descending back to the Eiger glacier
gondola station. This descent might be harder than the via ferrata. In some
places the hands are required to get down, and there are also some ropes
installed to ease downclimbing.

After a toilet break at the gondola station, we hike the Eiger trail. The first
part is identical to our approach this morning, but then continues along the
Eiger north face. Unfortunately, the face gets increasingly covered in clouds as
we hike along it. At the end of the trail, we descent to Alpiglen, where we have
some drinks before taking the cog railway back down to Grindelwald.

The tour took about 4.5h without breaks and involved about 1000m of elevation.
