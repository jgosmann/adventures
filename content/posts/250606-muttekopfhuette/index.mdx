For the Pentecost weekend, I organized a climbing trip to the Muttekopfhütte
(“mutte head cabin”). In the outskirts of Munich, I meet up with Fabian and
Susanne. With her camper we drive to Imst where we pick up Carlo and Jonas,
friends of Susanne, from the train station. They are also staying at the
Muttekopfhütte this weekend by pure chance.

At the parking lot of the cable car, we also meet Marco. While Carlo and Jonas
take the cable car half-way up, the rest of us decides to hike up despite our
heavy packs. The path turns out to be quite nice and surprisingly only a short
stretch is on a gravel road. We make it up in about 140 minutes and take only about
30 minutes longer than Carlo and Jonas.

At the cabin, we have drinks and some food (they offer delicious Kaspressknödel).
Then, we go to the nearby Guggerköpfle (about 20 minutes away) to still get in some
climbing this afternoon while the weather is still sunny. Unfortunately, it is
expected to get rainy the next days.

Marco and I decide to do the three-pitch route Eiertanz <Grade system="UIAA"
value="7-" />. I get to lead the second pitch which is the crux pitch.
Unfortunately, I have to take a short rest in the rope. Afterwards, when setting
up the anchor, my tuber slides off my carabiner when taking it off my harness
and flies down. Insert some cursing here. Luckily, I know how to belay with
a Munter hitch and this does not prevent us from completing the route. After
topping out, we walk back down and I find my tuber nicely presented on the
cliff base. I take a mental note to be more careful in the future. On a long
multi-pitch, it might have been gone forever.

Fabian and Susanne wanted to try an easier multi-pitch, but they end up starting
the wrong line, one next to it which is only a single pitch route. So they have
to repel down again.

On the way back to the cabin, we meet Anna and Marcel, who will also join us for
this weekend.

After dinner in the cabin, Marco, Susanne, Jonas, and Carlo do the nearby
waterfall via ferrata, while the rest of us relaxes a bit.
