My father and I do the Gerlossteinwand via ferrata today, while my mum hikes up
the normal way. Our ways split close to the approach's end after about 40
minutes. Given that the via ferrata is graded D, I find it a little bit soft. In
comparison to other via ferratas of the grade, little arm strength is required,
especially in the first half. Many of the difficult parts are in corners that
allow to always have a lot of weight on the feet. There are also quite a few
slabs that allow for stemming moves. With such moves you use the stronger
triceps instead the biceps.

Part of the via ferrata was obviously going through a rockfall zone. One steel
rung was even completely bent.

After about 90 minutes, at the Gerlosstein summit (2166m) we meet up with my mum
and have a break. Then we descent via a hiking trail back to the top station of
the gondola and take it back down.

Back at the bottom station of the gondola in Hainzenberg about an hour later, we
notice that it still takes over an hour for the bus back to arrive. Thus, we
decide to descent via some hiking trails to Zell am Ziller.

Shortly after we pass the pilgrimage church “Maria Rast”, it turns out that
the path is completely blocked by trees blown over by a recent storm. We climb
over the first few in the hope that we can make it through, but it the
devastation is too large. There is a bus stop nearby, but it is only served by
buses in the wrong direction. We would need to go back to where we came from and
then wait for the bus that we didn't want to wait for in the first place.
Eventually we decide for the only alternative: walking down along the main road.
At least on can walk somewhat comfortably behind the guard rails without
immediate danger to be run over. After about 1:10h we reach the Zell am Ziller
train station. We ascended 530m and descended 870m today.
