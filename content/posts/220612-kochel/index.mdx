This weekend Fabian, Vesna, Vroni and I decide to go climbing near Kochel.
Usually there is a direct train from Munich to Kochel. Unfortunately, due to
some technical issue, we will have to change trains in Tutzing. This is not
really a problem, but Vroni wanted to join us in the train at the Munich Pasing
stop (instead of central station) and somehow the online timetable does not show
the train as stopping in Pasing anymore. While it still stops there, it caused
enough confusion for Vroni to only be able to catch the train an hour later.

The rest of us arrives in Kochel at the planned time. However, a lot of other
people arrive with us and want to take the same bus. I suppose this is the
effect of the €9 ticket that got introduced for this summer by the German
government. It allows one to use all regional public transport in Germany for
a whole month and is intended to offset the inflation and gas prizes caused by
the war in Ukraine.

We decide to not even try to get onboard of the bus, but to walk. This takes us
about 45 to 60 minutes, but at least Vroni (who manages to get on board of the
next bus) arrives about the same time as we at the crag.

We first stay at the Riversidewall and warm up on the easiest route of the wall:
Kamikaze Frosch (“kamikaze frog“, <Grade system="UIAA" value="5+" />). Then we
try two slightly harder routes that I manage to redpoint on the second or third
try each.

Finally, we make a short stop at the Erdbeerwand (“strawberry wall”). On the
approach I, indeed, find a tiny wild strawberry. There we only do some easy <Grade system="UIAA" value="4" />
(not sure which one, we just pick a random
route because everything on this wall is easy). I have no trouble climbing it in
my approach shoes. We also show Vroni how to clean a sport route.

Afterwards, it is already surprisingly late (close to 6pm) and we make our way to
the bus stop. The bus arrives late and does not even stop because it is full
again. So we also have to walk back (with another group of four unlucky
climbers). This means we miss one train and will get back home even another hour
later. But at least we had a good day of climbing.
