Instead of rock climbing, I did a hike with Fabian this weekend. It was a long
tour and we took the train at 6:32am to Oberammergau. From there, we first
summited the Ettaler Manndl (1636m).

The last part before the summit was not a normal hiking trail, but a [via
ferrata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_ferrata). So some easy climbing was
involved in actually getting to the top. It was the lowest difficulty rating
as far as climbing or via ferratas go, so as experienced climbers, we did it
without the backup of a via ferrata set. Though, we had to be a little bit
careful because the rock was quite polished and some blocks were a bit loose,
but the steel cable was solid.

We then descended to Ettal, a little village with a monestary.

On the other side of Ettal, we then had climb another mountain, the Notkarspitze
(1889m). This was getting quite tiresome after having already done a whole
mountain.

We then descended to Farchant. And the village border Fabian noted that we could
make the next train back if we were fast enough. So we decided to run the
remaining distance to the train station. That was much more of a challange then
I expected with the heavy mountain boots on the feet after a whole day of hiking
with a considerable change in elevation and having just descended about 1000m.
Completely exhausted, we arrived at the train station where Fabian found out
that he messed up the schedule and the train was 20 minutes later than he
thought.

Anyways it was a challenging, but great hike. It took us about 8:20h of walking
time. We ascended a total of 2075m and descended 2225m. That is much more than
I have done in a single day in a long time.
