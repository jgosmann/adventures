We have an extended breakfast. The weather doesn't look that great. We get
repeated heavy showers, but at least it is supposed to get a bit better later
before it will get worse towards the evening. We spend some of the time to cut
vegetabales in preparation for today's dinner (Pad Thai). Around 11am we
finally deem the weather to be sufficiently dry and start towards the starting
point of today's hike along a ridge line, crossing three summits: Sonnenkopf
(1712m), Heidelbeerkopf (1767m), Schnippenkopf (1833m).

At the beginning of the hike, the weather is still unstable. Every once in
a while it starts raining, just to stop again ten minutes later. A few hundred
meters of elevation below we reach the ridge line, we shortly seek cover under
some trees during a more intense shower, and debate how to continue. We decide
to continue to the Sonnenkopf, that we have almost reached, and then
re-evaluate. From there we could descend back early. On the way, the rain stops
again. Then, on the summit we have a little break and eat our packed lunches
while it starts to rain a little bit again. But then it stops once more and from
our vantage point it looks like it is going to stay dry for at least a little
while now. We continue to check the rain radar that also says that the rain is
over for while.

So we continue to the Heidelbeerkopf, which translates to blueberry head.
Indeed, it is covered in blueberry shrubs. From there we go on to the
Schnippenkopf and descend and circle back. It stays indeed dry.

Back home we can even enjoy some sun on the patio, while we wait for Susanne to
arrive, who will join us for the remainder of the vacation. After eating South
Tyrolean apple strudel (that Kristina made) and catching up for a bit, Kristina,
Fabian, and Susanne go for a run, while Martin and I stay back home. I haven't
been running for quite some time and I'm afraid that I will get sore legs. I'd
rather avoid that expecting another hike tomorrow. Though, to be honest, my legs
are already sore from yesterday while trying to keep up with Fabian across the
ridge line.

After the runner's return, we have a short yoga session before dinner. The dinner
happens to be quite late because the stove in the flat is quite slow to heat up
(or the cookware is slow to transfer the heat). So afterwards, we end up in bed
pretty soon. Especially, as tomorrow the weather is only supposed to be good in
the morning.
