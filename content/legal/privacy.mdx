# Privacy Policy

Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed
by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and
user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.

Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection
Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any
operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization,
structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available,
alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on
personal data, whether by automated means or not.

The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the
type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data
either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you
below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and
improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also
processing data they collect and control.

Our privacy policy is structured as follows:

1. Information about us as controllers of your data
2. The rights of users and data subjects
3. Information about the data processing

## 1. Information about us as controllers of your data

The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data
protection law is:

## 2. The rights of users and data subjects

With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users
and data subjects have the right

- to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
  information about the data being processed, further information about the
  nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
- to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
- to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO),
  or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17
  Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
- to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to
  have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20
  GDPR);
- to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data
  concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data
  protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).

In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it
discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on
processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation
does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate
effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.

**Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to
object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art.
6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the
purpose of direct advertising is permissible.**
