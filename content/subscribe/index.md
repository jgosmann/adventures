<h3>RSS Feed</h3>

{{% md %}}
The blog provides an [RSS feed]({{< ref path="/" outputFormat="rss" >}}) that
can deliver new posts directly to you. [A short explanation of RSS can be found
here.](http://www.whatisrss.com/)

To get the updates delivered automatically, you have a variety of options:

* You can use an RSS reader software. You will find lots of choices on you
  favourite search engine. Personally, I use the [NewsFox plugin for
  Firefox](http://newsfox.mozdev.org/).
* Many might prefer to get email notifications. Currently, I am not offering
  such a service myself for technical and legal reasons. But there are online
  services that send you email notifications based on an RSS feed:
  * [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/applets/147561p-rss-feed-to-email) (stands for If
    This Than That), can do a lot more than just delivering email notifications
    for RSS feeds.
